This column uses a dynamic general equilibrium model calibrated to data from Uganda to characterise the macroeconomics of the pandemic and its aftermath in sub-Saharan Africa. It finds that the recovery depends significantly on how the public finances are restored to sustainability, and may be accelerated with external support.},

This definition highlights social resilience in relation to the concept of ecological resilience which is a characteristic of ecosystems to maintain themselves in the face of disturbance. There is a clear link between social and ecological resilience, particularly for social groups or communities that are dependent on ecological and environmental resources for their livelihoods. But it is not clear whether resilient ecosystems enable resilient communities in such situations. This article examines whether resilience is a useful characteristic for describing the social and economic situation of social groups and explores potential links between social resilience and ecological resilience. The origins of this interdisciplinary study in human ecology, ecological economics and rural sociology are reviewed, and a study of the impacts of ecological change on a resource-dependent community in contemporary coastal Vietnam in terms of the resilience of its institutions is outlined.},

We find that laws that increase the cost of dispute resolution or employment protection substantially reduce registered sector employment and output, although the cost of industrial dispute regulation on output is larger. There is evidence of strong complementarities on labor laws: The output or employment costs of EPL are larger in states and periods where it is more difficult to resolve disputes, and not very important when such costs are low. Workers do not benefit from EPL or DL, as they do not increase the labor share or the wage bill, although EPL has a small positive effect on earnings per worker. Labor-intensive industries, such as textiles, are the hardest hit by amendments that increase employment protection while capital-intensive industries are the most affected by laws that increase the cost of labor dispute resolution.

Target 4.1 specifies not just that all children complete primary and secondary school but that this schooling leads to â€œrelevant and effective learning outcomesâ€ and Indicator 4.1.1 tracks progress goal using the proportion of children reaching â€œminimum proficiencyâ€ at early (grade 2/3), intermediate (primary complete) and late (end if lower secondary) stages of basic education with the aim that "all youthâ€¦achieve literacy and numeracy" (Target 4.6). We use the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) data from India and Pakistan, and Uwezo data from Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda that assess all children in a given age range, whether in school or not, on simple measures of learning in math, reading (local language), and English, to quantify how much achieving within country equality between the richest 20 percent and the poorest 40 percent in (a) grade attainment and (b) learning achievement by grade would contribute to an SDG-like global equity goal of universal numeracy and literacy for all children by age 12âˆ’13. We have three empirical findings. First, except in Kenya equalizing grade attainment between children from rich and poor households would lead to only modest progress in achieving universal numeracy, closing only between 8\% (India) and 25 \% (Pakistan) of the existing gap to universal literacy. Second, equalizing the learning profiles, that is, closing the gap in learning for children in the same grade between those from the poorest 40 percent of households and the richest 20 percent, would close between 16 \% (Pakistan and Uganda) and 34 \% (India) of the gap to universal numeracy, and between 13 \% (Uganda) and 44 \% (India) of the gap to universal literacy. Third, even with complete equality in grade attainment and learning achievement with children from the richest 20 percent children from poorer households still be far from the equity goal of universal numeracy and literacy, as even children from the richest 20 percent of households are far from universal mastery of basic reading and math by ages 12âˆ’13. In the currently low performing countries achieving universal literacy and numeracy to reach even a minimal proficiency of global equity goal will require more than just closing the rich-poor learning gap, it will take progress in learning for all.},

The first two methods (dashboard and composite indices) are implemented using aggregate data from different sources ignoring the joint distribution of deprivations The other methods reflect the joint distribution and are implemented using data in which information on each dimension is available for each unit of analysis. After outlining each method, we provide a critical evaluation by discussing its advantages and disadvantages.},

The proposed indices are sensitive both to (i) the share of dimensions in which people are deprived and (ii) the duration of their multidimensional poverty experience. A related set of indices is proposed to measure transient poverty. An empirical illustration is provided for Chile between 1996 and 2006.},

  abstract = {The recently-adopted global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will have significant implications for national development planning in both developed and developing countries in the post-2015 period to 2030. Integrated, nationally-owned SDG strategies will be at the centre of national efforts to implement the new sustainable development agenda. The long-run processes and systems perspective that are inherent in the SDGs present complex analytical problems for policymakers and analysts. Scenario analysis and quantitative modelling will be important analytical tools to support national sustainable development planning, and there is an increasingly sophisticated suite of models available to decision makers. This paper reviews and assesses a broad range of different quantitative models that have the potential to support national development planning for the SDGs. The study develops a typology and inventory of 80 different models, and then reviews the comparative strengths, weaknesses and general utility of different models through an initial screening and subsequent multi-criteria analysis of short-listed models. Current gaps in model capabilities are highlighted in the context of providing analytical support for national development planning for the SDGs. While some existing models are particularly relevant, it is unlikely that an ideal model can analyse all SDG targets and variables of interest within a single modelling framework. Top-down â€˜macro frameworkâ€™ models are likely to be more useful for undertaking system-level or economy-wide scenario analysis driven by the national long-term goals and targets, and for exploring trade-offs and synergies among sectors. Bottom-up sectoral models will be able to support far more detailed option-level impact analysis of concrete interventions, technologies and investments. Combining both approaches within an analytical framework will provide a robust approach for analysis and decision-making. The results highlight a range of potential gaps in current modelling capabilities, and provide some new tools to assist with model selection.},

While other English-speaking countries have also experienced sharp increases in the top 1 percent income share, many high-income countries such as Japan, France, or Germany have seen much less increase in top income shares. Hence, the explanation cannot rely solely on forces common to advanced countries, such as the impact of new technologies and globalization on the supply and demand for skills. Moreover, the explanations have to accommodate the falls in top income shares earlier in the twentieth century experienced in virtually all high-income countries. We highlight four main factors. The first is the impact of tax policy, which has varied over time and differs across countries. Top tax rates have moved in the opposite direction from top income shares. The effects of top rate cuts can operate in conjunction with other mechanisms. The second factor is a richer view of the labor market, where we contrast the standard supply-side model with one where pay is determined by bargaining and the reactions to top rate cuts may lead simply to a redistribution of surplus. Indeed, top rate cuts may lead managerial energies to be diverted to increasing their remuneration at the expense of enterprise growth and employment. The third factor is capital income. Overall, private wealth (relative to income) has followed a U-shaped path over time, particularly in Europe, where inherited wealth is, in Europe if not in the United States, making a return. The fourth, little investigated, element is the correlation between earned income and capital income, which has substantially increased in recent decades in the United States.},

The US decennial census was created to apportion seats in the House of Representatives among the states. The race classification derives from the provisions of the 1787 federal Constitution, which required that the census differentiate slave and free persons and exclude Indians not taxed for the purposes of Congressional apportionment. The current race and classification used by federal agencies is promulgated by the Office of Management and Budget as `Standards for Maintaining, Collecting, and Presenting Data on Race and Ethnicity'. The article traces the history of the categories, the development of methods for measuring census accuracy, particularly for measuring undercount, and the conceptualization of the differential undercount as a minority undercount. Finally it discusses potential implications of the recent changes in the classification to permit identification with more than one race category on the measurement of census accuracy.},

  abstract = {Import barriers are often raised during turbulent times, as governments worry about immediate domestic concerns such as unemployment. The recent global financial crisis, however, was accompanied by an exogenous upward spike in the international price of food, which led some countries to raise export barriers, thereby exacerbating both the price spike and the international welfare transfer associated with that change in the terms of trade. As in previous price-spike periods, that response by some food-exporting countries was accompanied by a lowering of import restrictions by numerous food-importing countries, further exacerbating the international price spike. This paper provides new evidence up to 2010 on the extent of the change in domestic relative to international prices in both groups of countries, and compares it with responses during two previous food price-spike periods. It concludes that there is a need for stronger World Trade Organization disciplines on export as well as import restrictions, so as to limit the extent to which beggar-thy-neighbour government responses to international price spikes (up or down) exacerbate those shocks.},

  abstract = {Human capitalâ€”that is, resources associated with the knowledge and skills of individualsâ€”is a critical component of economic development1,2. Learning metrics that are comparable for countries globally are necessary to understand and track the formation of human capital. The increasing use of international achievement tests is an important step in this direction3. However, such tests are administered primarily in developed countries4, limiting our ability to analyse learning patterns in developing countries that may have the most to gain from the formation of human capital. Here we bridge this gap by constructing a globally comparable database of 164~countries from 2000 to 2017. The data represent 98\% of the global population and developing economies comprise two-thirds of the included countries. Using this dataset, we show that global progress in learningâ€”a priority Sustainable Development Goalâ€”has been limited, despite increasing enrolment in primary and secondary education. Using an accounting exercise that includes a direct measure of schooling quality, we estimate that the role of human capital in explaining income differences across countries ranges from a fifth to half; this result has an intermediate position in the wide range of estimates provided in earlier papers in the literature5â€“13. Moreover, we show that average estimates mask considerable heterogeneity associated with income grouping across countries and regions. This heterogeneity highlights the importance of including countries at various stages of economic development when analysing the role of human capital in economic development. Finally, we show that our database provides a measure of human capital that is more closely associated with economic growth than current measures that are included in the Penn world tables version 9.014 and the human development index of the United Nations15.},

The effect is examined for each country separately and also collectively by combining each country. Design/methodology/approach Ordinary least square regression method is applied to examine the effects of infrastructure investment and development on economic growth for each country. Panel data techniques such as panel least square method, panel least square fixed-effect model and panel least square random effect model are used to examine the collective impact by combining all countries in BRICS. The dynamic panel model is also incorporated for analysis in the study. Findings The results of the study are mixed. The association between infrastructure investment and development and economic growth for countries within BRICS is not robust. There is an insignificant relationship between infrastructure investment and development and economic growth in Brazil and South Africa. Energy and transportation infrastructure investment and development lead to economic growth in Russia. Telecommunication infrastructure investment and development and economic growth have a negative relationship in India, whereas there is a negative association between transport infrastructure investment and development and economic growth in China. Panel data results conclude that energy infrastructure investment and development lead to economic growth, whereas telecommunication infrastructure investment and development are significant and negatively linked with economic growth. Originality/value The study is novel as time series analysis and panel data analysis are used, taking the time span for 38 years (1980â€“2017) to investigate the influence of infrastructure investment and development on economic growth in BRICS Countries. Time-series regression analysis is used to test the impact for individual countries separately, whereas panel data regression analysis is used to examine the impact collectively for all countries in BRICS.},

Employing creative strategies to identify systematic biases in statistical outputs, these studies have shown that political manipulation of economic statistics does occur. But they have paid less attention to the question how official statistics are being manipulated. To shed light on the processes behind data manipulation, this article examines three recent high-profile cases in depth: Greeceâ€™s public deficit figures, controversies about Argentinaâ€™s inflation statistics, and the Brazilian â€œfiscal pedalingâ€ scandal. We make two main contributions: first, macroeconomic indicators are much more ambiguous than it is commonly realized. Therefore, the line between accurate and manipulated data is more blurry than typical narratives about manipulation acknowledge. Second, in recognition of this ambiguity we introduce a typology distinguishing four types of manipulation: outright manipulation (type 1), politically motivated guesstimating (type 2), the opportunistic use of methodology space (type 3), and indicators-management through indirect means (type 4). The findings from our cases highlight that the politics of statistics do not revolve around â€œrightâ€ and â€œwrongâ€ numbers. They are better understood as contestations about different shades of wrong.},

This paper employs the unexpected 1999 Brazilian exchange rate devaluation to identify the effects of exporting on Brazilian manufacturing firm-level wages using employerâ€“employee linked data. We find that this export shock increased the average wage gap between the high and low productivity firms. Most of this wage increase took the form of a larger wage premium, but increased sorting of workers also played a significant role. Further scrutiny at the occupationâ€“firm level indicates that the wage increases of managerial white-collar occupations came solely from wage premium variations. Skilled blue-collar workers also exhibited wage gains, but these gains came in equal shares from increased wage premium and worker sorting; the remaining occupational categories saw no wage increase.},

Co-designed with local partner organizations to be community-led and non-prescriptive, the program sought to encourage community participation to address local barriers in access to high quality care for pregnant women and infants. We evaluate the impact of this program through randomized controlled trials (RCTs), involving 100 treatment and 100 control communities in each country. We find that on average, this program did not have a statistically significant impact on the use or content of maternal and newborn health services, nor the sense of civic efficacy or civic participation among recent mothers in the communities who were offered it. These findings hold in both countries and in a set of prespecified subgroups. To identify reasons for the lack of impacts, we use a mixed-method approach combining interviews, observations, surveys, focus groups, and ethnographic studies that together provide an in-depth assessment of the complex causal paths linking participation in the program to improvements in MNH outcomes. Although participation in program meetings was substantial and sustained in most communities, and most attempted at least some of what they had planned, only a minority achieved tangible improvements and fewer still saw more than one such success. Our assessment is that the main explanation for the lack of impact is that few communities were able to traverse the complex causal paths from planning actions to accomplishing tangible improvements in their access to quality health care.},

Our wealth measure is unusually comprehensive, capturing not only reproducible and human capital but also natural capital, health improvements and technological change. We apply the framework to five countries: the United States, China, Brazil, India and Venezuela. We show that the often-neglected contributors to wealth â€“ technological change, natural capital and health capital â€“ fundamentally affect the conclusions one draws about whether given nations are achieving sustainability. Indeed, even countries that display sustainability differ considerably in the kinds of capital that contribute to it.},

Despite this growing trend, there is neither an agreement upon a standard procedure nor a comprehensive assessment of existing measurement frameworks in the relevant literature. To tackle these challenges, this study (1) proposes an overarching eight-step procedure for composite indicator building and (2) develops a meta-level assessment framework to allow for a systematic review of existing disaster resilience measurement frameworks in application of composite indicator building. This meta-level framework was established on the basis of the proposed eight-step composite indicator building procedure and qualified with the introduction of 19 dimensions and 36 metrics for quality assessment. In order to select relevant disaster resilience measures for this analysis, the study applied a systematic survey to collect measures based on four inclusion criteria: community-based, multifaceted, quantitative, and operationalized. Accordingly, 17 resilience measurement frameworks were chosen for further analysis in this review. The results of the quality assessment demonstrated that, from the theoretical perspective, resilience assessments originate from either the socio-ecological or engineering fields and can be classified into two main types of resilience indices and tools. This differs from results of the methodological perspective, which indicate that resilience measures can be characterized as deductive or similar to hierarchical and inductive assessments.},

The 2017 PPPs have the opposite effect: extreme poverty decreases in Sub-Saharan Africa, reducing the global poverty estimate slightly by 0.6pp to 9.4 percent in 2015 (equivalent to 46 million fewer poor people). The long-run trends in global and regional poverty remain unchanged.},

  abstract = {This four-part analysis describes the current suite of food security measures, then analyzes the respective relationships between food security and poverty, GDP, and crop yields using findings from in-depth literature reviews. Food security measures are criticized for inaccurately characterizing food security at individual, household, and national scales, yet guidelines exist to prescribe a food security measure for a given situation. Some authors see the potential of a combination of indicators that apply at different scales rather than a single, universal food security measure. Limited literature exists on the relationship between food security and poverty, GDP, or crop yields. The relationship between food security and poverty is particularly challenging because neither term has a consistent definition, and the limited literature suggests a lack of consensus among experts. Little empirical research exists on the relationship between food security and GDP, though studies generally note an association between the two Studies that evaluate food security and crop yields provide limited evidence that the two are associated, though many studies use measures of crop yield as food security indicators and vice versa. More research is needed to establish whether there are preferred food security measurement tools for specific scales and situations, and to further explore the relationship between food security and poverty, GDP, and crop yields.},

Rising imports cause higher unemployment, lower labor force participation, and reduced wages in local labor markets that house import-competing manufacturing industries. In our main specification, import competition explains one-quarter of the contemporaneous aggregate decline in US manufacturing employment. Transfer benefits payments for unemployment, disability, retirement, and healthcare also rise sharply in more trade-exposed labor markets.},

We first identify 908 unique estimates of the effects of FTAs on different trading pairs for the years 1986â€“2006. We then employ these estimates as our dependent variable in a â€œsecond stageâ€ analysis characterizing the heterogeneity in these effects. Interestingly, most of this heterogeneity (âˆ¼2/3) occurs within FTAs (rather than across different FTAs), with asymmetric effects within pairs (on exports vs. imports) also playing an important role. Our second stage analysis provides several intuitive explanations behind these variations. Even within the same agreement, FTA effects are weaker for more distant pairs and for pairs with otherwise high levels of ex ante trade frictions. The effects of new FTAs are similarly weaker for pairs with existing agreements already in place. In addition, we are able to relate asymmetries in FTA effects to each country's ability to influence the other's terms of trade. Out-of-sample predictions incorporating these insights enable us to predict direction-specific effects of future FTAs between any pair of countries. A simulation of the general equilibrium effects of TTIP demonstrates the significance of our methods.},

The impetus for this research comes from the ongoing and expanding convolution of the concepts of democracy and governance by academics, international institutions and policymakers. One of the more important areas of research that is affected by this convolution argues that democracies guarantee the rule of law and provide superior institutions which considerably influence not only developing statesâ€™ overall development trajectories, but also multinational firmsâ€™ decisions on where to do business. I argue that these superior institutions, such as the rule of law and quality bureaucracy, are separate from the institutions of democracy and constitute the concept of governance infrastructure. Moreover, it is the institutions that comprise governance infrastructure and not the institutions of democracy that are key institutional determinants of developing statesâ€™ economic outcomes. Therefore, only by appropriately conceptualizing governance infrastructure, as is done in this article, and separating it theoretically and empirically from democracy will scholars and policymakers move forward in understanding the determinants of economic development.},

It traces the meaning of transparency from its use by nongovernmental and supranational organizations to its use in the international relations, nonprofit, public policy, and administration literature. It finds that the definition of transparency reveals three metaphors: transparency as a public value embraced by society to counter corruption, transparency synonymous with open decision-making by governments and nonprofits, and transparency as a complex tool of good governance in programs, policies, organizations, and nations. In the first metaphor, transparency is subtly intertwined with accountability. In the second, as transparency encourages openness, it increases concerns for secrecy and privacy. In the third, policymakers create transparency alongside accountability, efficiency, and effectiveness. The analysis concludes that these meanings affect the way organization members conduct and will conduct their day-to-day activities and how policies are and will be created. Transparency is becoming an unofficial mandate by the public and is often a legal mandate.},

But how actually does one live on less than \$1 per day?  This essay is about the economic lives of the extremely poor: the choices they face, the constraints they grapple with, and the challenges they meet.  A number of recent data sets and a body of new research allow us to start building an image of the way the extremely poor live their lives. Our discussion builds on household surveys conducted in 13 countries: Cote d'Ivoire, Guatemala, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Peru, South Africa, Tanzania, and Timor Leste (East Timor). These surveys provide detailed information on extremely poor households around the world, from Asia to Africa to Latin America, including information on what they consume, where they work, and how they save and borrow. We consider the extremely poor -- those living in households where the consumption per capita is less than \$1.08 per person per day -- as well as the merely "poor" -- defined as those who live under \$2.16 a day -- using 1993 purchasing power parity as benchmark. In keeping with convention, we call these the \$1 and \$2 dollar poverty lines, respectively.},

  abstract = {Adaptation finance addresses the effects of climate variability and change on development and physical insecurity. Yet, adaptation has proven difficult to systematically measure and assess, resulting in a lack of coherent and comparable evidence to learn about good adaptation practice. Measurement has become even more challenging since the integration of resilience into policy framings. Measuring climate resilience requires evidence of resistance to, and recovery from, shocks and stresses. But resilience of what, to what seldom guides the design of assessments. Researchers tend to use proxy indicators and aggregated units of analysis that cloud the relationships under study, and crucially, leave unclear the interactions between climate and development. This viewpoint documents these common barriers to progress in the field. It then outlines two methods for practitioners and researchers to link climate shocks and stresses to climate-sensitive development outcomes as a key first step to research and evaluation design. Both methods enable prediction of expected levels of development outcomes, given the extent of climate shocks and stresses, which is then comparable with actual levels achieved under climate resilience interventions. The product is standardized and comparable metrics to learn about the performance of climate adaptation policymaking and resilient development programming.},

It employs sign restrictions to identify four external structural shocks â€“ demand, supply, monetary and commodity shocks, and relates their impact to countries' policy and structural framework. External shocks account for a small share of the variance of GDP, especially at short horizons. However, their relative contribution has risen in recent decades, as the incidence of domestic shocks has declined. Global monetary shocks have become the leading external source of GDP volatility in developing countries. At short horizons, real and financial openness raise the share of volatility attributable to external shocks. At longer horizons, financial openness helps reduce the volatility contribution of global real shocks, but not that of global monetary shocks, thus augmenting the relative role of the latter. Commodity-intensive countries exhibit higher vulnerability to all types of external shocks, not just commodity shocks.},

To test this assumption, we collected data from 508 women working in women groups in Addis Ababa. Besides the economic dimension, five other dimensions of empowerment were studied (familial, legal, psychological, political and socioâ€cultural). Findings show that the relationships between these six dimensions of empowerment are weak and that the psychological dimension is most central. The economic dimension is hardly connected to other dimensions. Hence, a broad package of interventions seems needed to achieve empowerment in all respects.

It also has been mentioned in UN Sustainable Development Goals 6 to ensure that all people will have equal access to both water and sanitation service, as well as embedded in Goal 10 that aims to reduce inequality and promoting inclusiveness. However, the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme 2017 reported that 844 million people are still living without basic access to water, and 2.3 billion are still excluded from basic sanitation service. In this study, we present quantitative global-scale analysis of inequality of accessing the water and sanitation services from different wealth groups in 82 developing countries. We found that access inequality is rampant among developing countries particularly in terms of accessing basic sanitation service which the poor populations tend to be excluded in accessing the basic service. Based on combined multiple global data sets, we further identify which components of water governance are the key contributors to access inequality in water and sanitation services. We conclude that social and political dimension of water governance, such as government effectiveness, are influencing the occurrence of inequality of access to sanitation service in developing countries, while the inequality of access to basic water service was strongly influenced by the economic aspect of water governance, such as absorption of aid funds.},

Individuals who are vulnerable to the effects of extreme weather, namely the poor, the elderly/disabled, children, prisoners, and substance abusers have experienced heightened levels of mental, emotional, and bodily stress due to natural disaster exposure. Researchers from a variety of disciplines, public health, social science, and environmental studies, in particular, are examining how natural disasters are impacting mental and physical health functioning while noting the demographic factors leaving certain groups more susceptible to harm. A systematic literature review was conducted on the past 12 years of research that examined natural disaster-related experiences and psychological and physiological health outcomes on populations who are more vulnerable to adverse weather impacts. It was found that the mental and physical health of marginalized populations during and after a natural disaster were elevated and/or exacerbated by circumstances pertaining to the weather event and the lack of disaster-response actions. It was also found that fostering social capital is a way to combat stressors in disadvantaged communities. It is imperative that clinicians and policy makers confront the issue of climate change and natural disasters, developing relief efforts and preventative measures to secure the well-being of underserved groups who may not have many resources at their disposal.},

  abstract = {Despite all theoretically and empirically motivated criticism of GDP as a social welfare and progress indicator, its role in economics, public policy, politics and society continues to be influential. To resolve this paradox, one has to recognize that many economists accept the criticism of the GDP indicator but deny its relevance. This paper evaluates the reasons for denial. This entails five steps: (1) a brief review is offered of the extensive literature showing that GDP per capita (growth) is far from a robust indicator of social welfare (progress); (2) the influence of GDP information on economic decisions by firms, consumers, investors and governments is examined; (3) behavioural explanations for a widespread belief in the relevance of GDP are discussed; (4) the customary arguments in favour of the GDP indicator are analysed; and (5) proposed alternatives to GDP are evaluated. The paper ends with outlining the implications of giving less attention to GDP information in policy and politics. It is argued that removal of the information failure which GDP represents, in monitoring economic progress and guiding public policy, will lead to decisions and developments being more in line with improving human well-being. Moreover, ignoring GDP information is consistent with a perfectly neutral stance regarding economic (GDP) growth. Indeed, an unconditional anti- or pro-growth imperative acts as an unnecessary constraint on our search for human progress.},

Third, it suggests that between-firm wage dispersion is linked to increasing differences between high and low productivity firms. Fourth, it suggests that both globalisation and digitalisation imply higher wage divergence, but strengthen the link between productivity and wage dispersion. Finally, it investigates the impact of minimum wage, employment protection legislation, trade union density, and coordination in wage setting on wage dispersion and its link to productivity dispersion.},

Citiesâ€™ economic efficiency requires, therefore, avoiding any spatial fragmentation of labor markets. In simpler terms, it means that all the locations where jobs are offered should, at least potentially, be physically accessible from all householdsâ€™ place of residence within about an hourâ€™s travel time. This requirement should be born in mind when evaluating alternative urban shapes. Any type of spatial organization implying that homes and jobs should be matched individuallyâ€”i.e., that workers need to have good access only to their current job locationâ€”contradicts our premise that large competitive labor markets are efficient and that this efficiency alone justifies the complexity and high operating costs of large cities.},

However, drawing a distinction between statistics and lying ignores the process by which statistics are socially constructed. For instance, bad statistics often are disseminated by sincere, albeit innumerate advocates (e.g., inflated estimates for the number of anorexia deaths) or through research findings selectively highlighted to attract media coverage (e.g., a recent study on the extent of bullying). Further, the spread of computers has made the production and dissemination of dubious statistics easier. While critics may agree on the desirability of increasing statistical literacy, it is unclear who might accept this responsibility.},

  abstract = {With the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), debates on governance through goal-setting and performance review have gained momentum. In this article, we explore how the politics of performance review played out in public sustainable development reporting at the global-national nexus. By examining the case of Swedish reporting to the United Nations High Level Political Forum in 2017, we find policy translation, accountability preparation and identity formation to be key functions of SDG reporting. We draw attention to the performative and political features of these functions in the sustainable development realm. With a fast approaching deadline, policy translation of global indicators to the national context glossed over politically contentious issues. Reporting served to enable peer review among governments rather than hierarchical accountability of domestic politics. Moreover, the identity formation function of SDG reporting was strong on the international stage while domestically it was challenged by broader political struggles. In conclusion, our study bears witness of the formative power of public reporting for SDG governance. We call for comparative research to allow for further theory-building on the politics of public reporting on sustainable development.},

All variables are found stationary at first differencing both at constant and constant plus trend level under the ADF and PP stationary tests. The Johansen-Juselius procedure is applied to test the cointegrating relation between variables followed by a vector error correction model. The empirical results trace a strong long-run equilibrium relationship between GDP growth rates and the explanatory variables with unidirectional casual flows. The volume of FDI and level of capital formation are found to have significant positive effect on changes in real GDP. The degree of trade openness unleashes negative but diminishing influence on GDP growth rates. We conclude that Bangladesh should formulate FDI-led polices and ensure higher degree of capital formation to enhance her economic growth rates at large.},

We can and should build a better globalization that addresses enduring inequality, based on a radical analysis cognizant of the partiality, fragility and incompleteness of the existing global governance architecture, and which seeks to expand, upgrade and democratize the multilateral order. Second, following a postfinancial crisis interregnum replete with morbid symptoms, the Covid-19 shock potentially represents the dÃ©nouement of a long period of neoliberal decay, after which different approaches to globalization will be necessary. Finally, only a reformed G20 can provide the crucial coordinating function that any process of progressive reglobalization requires, with three necessary reforms: its proper institutionalization with a permanent Secretariat; a widening of its remit to cover all aspects of contemporary globalization; and a concomitant narrowing of its focus to discharge aggressively that specific coordinating function.},

Existing research focuses on the effects of Western development projects on inter-personal inequality and inequality across different subnational regions. However, China has recently become a major financier of economic infrastructure in Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, and Central and Eastern Europe, and it is unclear if these investments diffuse or concentrate economic activity. We introduce an original dataset of geo-located Chinese Governmentfinanced projects in 138 countries between 2000 and 2014, and analyze the effects of these projects on the spatial distribution of economic activity within host countries. We find that Chinese development projects in general, and Chinese transportation projects in particular, reduce economic inequality within and between subnational localities. Our results suggest that Chinese investments in â€œconnective infrastructureâ€ produce positive economic spillovers that lead to a more equal distribution of economic activity in the localities where they are implemented.},

  abstract = {Why the news about the global decline of infectious diseases is not all good. Plagues and parasites have played a central role in world affairs, shaping the evolution of the modern state, the growth of cities, and the disparate fortunes of national economies. This book tells that story, but it is not about the resurgence of pestilence. It is the story of its decline. For the first time in recorded history, virus, bacteria, and other infectious diseases are not the leading cause of death or disability in any region of the world. People are living longer, and fewer mothers are giving birth to many children in the hopes that some might survive. And yet, the news is not all good. Recent reductions in infectious disease have not been accompanied by the same improvements in income, job opportunities, and governance that occurred with these changes in wealthier countries decades ago. There have also been unintended consequences. In this book, Thomas Bollyky explores the paradox in our fight against infectious disease: the world is getting healthier in ways that should make us worry. Bollyky interweaves a grand historical narrative about the rise and fall of plagues in human societies with contemporary case studies of the consequences. Bollyky visits Dhaka--one of the most densely populated places on the planet--to show how low-cost health tools helped enable the phenomenon of poor world megacities. He visits China and Kenya to illustrate how dramatic declines in plagues have affected national economies. Bollyky traces the role of infectious disease in the migrations from Ireland before the potato famine and to Europe from Africa and elsewhere today. Historic health achievements are remaking a world that is both worrisome and full of opportunities. Whether the peril or promise of that progress prevails, Bollyky explains, depends on what we do next. A Council on Foreign Relations Book},

The 2019 United Nations World Water Development Report provided a dramatic status of world water, however without questioning the main drivers of an imminent water crisis, that were unbounded, unequal, economic, and population growth, within the context of reducing resources in a finite world. Despite the report was a small step forward in awareness, still, it was not proposing satisfactory remedies. With business-as-usual, without acting on the drivers of water scarcity, regional water crises were inevitable in the next 3 decades, starting from Africa. Constrained by political, financial, and energy burdens, the technological improvements that have helped humanity to deal with the increased demand for water, food, and energy over the last 70 years, were likely not enough to avoid the water crisis. On top of forecast is the Covid19 pandemic. Coronavirus cases are (August 4, 2020) 18,446,065 and fatalities are 697,202 worldwide, and still growing. The containment measures enforced for Covid19 infection following the examples in the United Kingdom have already produced significant damage to the world economy. This will limit social expenditures in general, and the expenditures for the water issue in particular. The water crisis will consequently become worse in the next months, with consequences still difficult to predict. This will be true especially for Africa, where the main problem has always been poverty. There is the opportunity of significant health, food, and water crisis, especially in Africa. While the concepts of washing hands and social distancing that are difficult to apply havenâ€™t produce so far major issues with the Covid19 outbreak in Africa, borders closure, restrictions on movement, and more poverty will translate in a lack of food and water potentially much more worrying than the virus spreading.},

I argue that a key dilemma for intersectionality researchers is that the additive (e.g., Black + Lesbian + Woman) versus intersectional (e.g., Black Lesbian Woman) assumption inherent in measurement and qualitative and quantitative data analyses contradicts the central tenet of intersectionality: social identities and inequality are interdependent for groups such as Black lesbians, not mutually exclusive. In light of this, interpretation becomes one of the most substantial tools in the intersectionality researcherâ€™s methodological toolbox.},

It focuses on initiatives by UN Women, including the Progress of the Worldâ€™s Women 2015â€“16. Our analysis of the data compiled by UN Women raises questions about what might account for the over-representation of women among the poor in official accounts of poverty, and how this is plausibly changing (or not) over time. The paper highlights that analysis of what is measured and how needs to be understood in relation to who is the focus of measurement. The lack of available data which is fit for purpose questions the extent to which gender poverty differences are â€˜realâ€™ or statistical. There is a continued reliance on comparing female with male headed households, and we argue the move by UN Women to adopt the notion of Female Only Households reflects available data driving conceptual understandings of womenâ€™s poverty, rather than conceptual advances driving the search for better data. Wider UN processes highlight that while sensitivity to differences among women and their subjectivities are paramount in understanding the multiple processes accounting for gender bias in poverty burdens, they are still accorded little priority. To monitor advances in Agenda 2030 will require more and better statistics. Our review suggests that we are still far from having a set of tools able to adequately measure and monitor gendered poverty.},

A rise in the numbers of women to men living in income-poor households has occurred despite feminized anti-poverty programs, most notably conditional cash transfers (CCTs), which target resources to women. This paper shows that methodological differences in what, how, and who is the focus of measurement may influence patterns of poverty â€œfeminization.â€ It also suggests that feminized policy interventions might in themselves be playing a role in the re-feminization of poverty, not least because of data and definitional limitations in the way female-headed households and, relatedly, womenâ€™s poverty are understood. The somewhat paradoxical interactions between the feminization of household headship, the feminization of poverty, and the feminization of anti-poverty programs present interesting challenges for redressing gender gaps in poverty within the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.},

Although we mention some of the substantive findings that can be established using these measures, our primary concern is with different ways to measure and understand ethnic identity â€“ the use of history, demography, surveys, primary source materials, content analysis, and discourse analysis. We argue that a combination of these methods must be used to fully comprehend the political role of ethnicity at the mass public or elite level.Ethnicity is an intersubjectively agreed-upon categorization of individuals that is widely and publicly understood to have meaning within a society. Consequently, social scientists often use ethnic categories to interpret and explain facts and events. For example, historians and demographers construct narratives or present data using ethnic categories, and survey researchers ask people about their ethnic identity (e.g., African American, Estonian, Tatar) to determine its prevalence and correlates in a society. Because ethnic identity also motivates human activity and matters for people's lives â€“ especially their political activity â€“ even more can be learned by asking people about these activities (or by observing them directly) as well as by asking them about their identity directly. Moreover, because ethnic identity is constructed through social and psychological processes of categorization (there is no primordial periodic table of social identities), much can be learned about it by studying cultural and social processes, such as the course of political arguments, debates in cultural journals, discussions in the mass media, and social movements that frame, evoke, and memorialize ethnic identities.},

Instead of measuring gender inequality in outcomes, the SIGI and its subindices measure long-lasting social institutions defined as societal practices and legal norms that frame gender roles. The SIGI combines them into a multidimensional index of women's deprivation caused by gendered social institutions. Inspired by the Fosterâ€“Greerâ€“Thorbecke poverty measures, the SIGI offers a new way of aggregating gender inequality by penalizing high inequality in each dimension and allowing only partial compensation between subindices. The indices identify countries and dimensions of gendered social institutions that deserve attention. Empirical results confirm that the SIGI complements other gender-related indices.},

  abstract = {Objectives Food and water insecurity have both been demonstrated as acute and chronic stressors and undermine human health and development. A basic untested proposition is that they chronically coexist, and that household water insecurity is a fundamental driver of household food insecurity. Methods We provide a preliminary assessment of their association using cross-sectional data from 27 sites with highly diverse forms of water insecurity in 21 low- and middle-income countries across Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and the Americas (N = 6691 households). Household food insecurity and its subdomains (food quantity, food quality, and anxiety around food) were estimated using the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale; water insecurity and subdomains (quantity, quality, and opportunity costs) were estimated based on similar self-reported data. Results In multilevel generalized linear mixed-effect modeling (GLMM), composite water insecurity scores were associated with higher scores for all subdomains of food insecurity. Rural households were better buffered against water insecurity effects on food quantity and urban ones for food quality. Similarly, higher scores for all subdomains of water insecurity were associated with greater household food insecurity. Conclusions Considering the diversity of sites included in the modeling, the patterning supports a basic theory: household water insecurity chronically coexists with household food insecurity. Water insecurity is a more plausible driver of food insecurity than the converse. These findings directly challenge development practices in which household food security interventions are often enacted discretely from water security ones.},

Within countries, aid disproportionately flows to regions with more of the richest people. Aid does not favor regions with more of the poorest people. These findings violate the stated preferences of the multilateral donors under study, suggesting that the donors either cannot or are not willing to exercise control over the location of aid projects within countries. The results also suggest that aid is not being allocated effectively to alleviate extreme poverty.},

As adaptation to climate change becomes the focus of increasing attention and the target of significant spending, there is a growing need for frameworks and tools that enable organisations to track and assess the outcomes of adaptation interventions. This paper presents a coherent framework for climate change adaptation programming, including potential indicators, or indicator categories/types, for tracking and evaluating the success of adaptation support and adaptation interventions. The paper begins with a discussion of some of the key issues related to the evaluation of adaptation, and outlines some of the main difficulties and constraints with respect to the development of adaptation indicators. Next, an evaluation framework is proposed and indicator categories or 'domains' are identified. Lastly, key conclusions are provided and a theory of change is outlined that shows how development and use of the framework could lead to more effective adaptation investments for climate resilient development.},

While our theoretical framework incorporates the conventional argument that China pulls in followers with economic benefits, we focus on grievances with the current global order that have the effect of pushing countries toward the rising new leader. We find that grievances about global financial instability are particularly important push factors. Our results show that countries that have experienced more financial crises, more variable capital account policies, more volatile portfolio capital outflows, and more social unrest during IMF programs are more likely to support China's global leadership than leaders of nations that have been less exposed to these problems. We find no evidence that grievances about global governance, or grievances about discriminatory US trade policies, are related to foreign support for China's global economic leadership. Overall, our evidence is consistent with the interpretation that leaders want to reform and preserve the WTO and the IMF, which have worked reasonably well for them under US leadership.

Using a panel time series approach and a large cross-country dataset, the paper estimates a long-run aggregate production function relating gross domestic product to human capital, physical capital, and a synthetic measure of infrastructure comprising transport, power and telecommunications. Tests of the cointegration rank allowing it to vary across countries reveal a common rank with a single cointegrating vector, which we interpret as the long-run production function. Estimation of its parameters is performed using the pooled mean group (PMG) estimator, which allows for unrestricted short-run parameter heterogeneity across countries while imposing the (testable) restriction of long-run parameter homogeneity. The long-run elasticity of output with respect to the synthetic infrastructure index ranges between 0.07 and 0.10. The estimates are highly significant, both statistically and economically, and robust to alternative dynamic specifications and infrastructure measures. Tests of parameter homogeneity fail to yield evidence that the long-run parameters differ across countries. Copyright Â© 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

This article charts the ascendancy of emerging economy perspectives through the lens of the G20, maps their ties to the IMF and other international organisations, sets out the content of the new global developmental liberalism, and assesses the implications of emerging economy hegemony for the advanced and the emerging economies, respectively.},

This report focuses on the experiences of three key donors: the United States (US), the United Kingdom (UK) and Germany. It also provides case studies showing the operationalisation of the agenda in three fragile states, namely, Afghanistan, Cambodia and Nepal. Because the FS agenda is relatively new, the policies, tools, and institutions to implement it are still being developed. To date, implementation efforts have remained largely uncoordinated and incomplete. Bringing coherence and â€˜joined-upâ€™ approaches to the operationalisation of fragile states programming is therefore a priority for the wide variety of actors involved.},

However, the promotion of open government dataâ€”through voluntary initiatives such as the Open Government Partnership and soft conditionalities tied to foreign aidâ€”has motivated many of the worldâ€™s more closed regimes to produce and publish fine-grained data on public goods provision, taxation, and more. While this has been a boon to scholars of autocracies, we argue that the politics of data production and dissemination in these countries create new challenges. Systematically missing or biased data may jeopardize research integrity and lead to false inferences. We provide evidence of such risks from Tanzania. The example also shows how data manipulation fits into the broader set of strategies that authoritarian leaders use to legitimate and prolong their rule. Comparing data released to the public on local tax revenues with verified internal figures, we find that the public data appear to significantly underestimate opposition performance. This can bias studies on local government capacity and risk parroting the party line in data form. We conclude by providing a framework that researchers can use to anticipate and detect manipulation in newly available data.},

Using instrumental variables estimation, we demonstrate that this aid has positive effects on human rights and democracy, although the effects are short-lived after the shock to aid dissipates. We adduce the timing of events, qualitative evidence, and theoretical insights to argue that the conditionality associated with an increased aid commitment is responsible for the positive effects in the domains of human rights and democracy.},

These processes include: the terms of inclusion of paid workers in global production systems, the barriers to inclusion of the self-employed in global production systems, and the patterns of exclusion from domestic production systems associated with imports and other aspects of trade liberalization. The authors argue that global integration is a 'political' outcome, meaning that formulating the right policies can lead to a better and more just globalization. They recommend a mix of protective measures for paid workers, policy, regulatory, and institutional reforms, and promote the representation of informal workers/producers. Unfavourable patterns of exclusion/inclusion are seen as a cause of income poverty, so by applying the appropriate policies a fairer globalization can be reached.},

Why and how do local aid projects increase individualsâ€™ perceptions of corruption in recipient communities? Using a geocoded dataset of Chinese official finance flows along with Afrobarometer survey data, I explore the effects of Chinese aid on corruption perceptions among citizens in African states. The main results indicate that exposure to Chinese assistance increases the perceived level of corruption of government officials and political leaders, while World Bank aid does not. I also examine whether the types and targeted sectors of aid have differential impacts on individual perceptions of political corruption. The results indicate that grants have a more consistent impact on corruption perceptions than do other types of aid, suggesting that grants may provide rents more easily to politicians. Besides, developmental projects for social infrastructure raise respondentsâ€™ reports of dishonesty among public officials more than other sectors. It is because those projects substitute essential public services, thus lowering the accountability of local governments. Moreover, when Chinese agencies implement projects by themselves, the impact of Chinese aid on corruption perceptions increases substantially. The findings suggest that Chinese aid may increase the awareness of political corruption in local African communities, due primarily to suspicions regarding interactions between China and local people in African states.},

The HPI was introduced in the United Nations Development Programme Human Development Report 1997 and concentrates on deprivations in basic dimensions of life. This paper develops an axiomatic characterization of a family of global deprivation indices using an arbitrary number of dimensions of human life. When we consider only the three basic dimensions, a member of this family becomes ordinally equivalent to HPI. The general index allows the calculation of percentage contributions of deprivations in different dimensions, and hence to identify the dimensions whose failures affect the overall deprivation more. This is important from a policy perspective. We also provide an empirical illustration of the characterized indices using cross-country data for the three basic dimensions and the anthropometric indicators birth weight, height for age and nourishment.},

  abstract = {The â€œfeminization of povertyâ€ is often referred to without adequate specification or substantiation, and does not necessarily highlight aspects of poverty that are most relevant to women at the grassroots. The United Nations Development Programme's gender indices go some way to reflecting gendered poverty, but there is scope for improvement. In order to work towards aggregate indices that are more sensitive to gender gaps in poverty as identified and experienced by poor women, the main aims of this paper are twoâ€fold. The first is to draw attention to existing conceptual and methodological weaknesses with the â€œfeminization of povertyâ€, and to suggest how the construct could better depict contemporary trends in gendered privation. The second is to propose directions for the kinds of data and indicators that might be incorporated within the Genderâ€related Development Index or the Gender Empowerment Measure, or used in the creation of a Gendered Poverty Index.},

Despite the abundance of literature and policy analyses regarding the effect of financial liberalization, the debate is far from settled. One of the reasons for that outcome is the lack of proper ways of measuring the extent of the openness in cross-border financial transactions. We seek to remedy this deficiency by creating an index aimed at measuring the extensity of capital controls based on the information from the IMF's Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions (AREAER). This paper details how we construct the data and where our index stands in relation to the extant literature. Given the intricacy of capital controls policies and regulations, the exercise of quantifying the extent of financial openness remains a challenging task. Nonetheless, our index makes a substantial contribution in terms of its coverage of countries and time period; the data are available for 181 countries for the 1970â€“2005 period.},

This article shows how the design of IMF conditionality is linked to the normative orientations of the staff and their common professional training. Professional ties from similar training help to bind the staff together around a shared set of normative orientations that inform the IMFâ€™s policy goals. When borrowing country officials do not share these orientations, the staff are motivated to tighten conditionality. This behavior also fits with staff concerns about time-inconsistency and moral hazard. I find robust statistical support for this argument using a dataset based on the professional ties that exist between the IMF staff and borrowing country officials. Yet conditionality is not found to be more lenient when country officials share the normative orientations of the IMF staff. Staff concerns about time-inconsistent preferences and moral hazard likely weigh against more lenient treatment where normative adherence is stronger.},

This number had increased by 63\% from 1990 to 2019. Regionally, the Western Pacific had the highest need of rehabilitation services (610 million people [588â€“636] and 83 million YLDs [62â€“106]).

Though U.S. preferences permeate World Bank decision making, we do not find evidence that borrower countries trade favors in exchange for active U.S. intervention on their behalf. Instead, we propose that U.S. influence operates indirectly when World Bank staffâ€”consciously or unconsciouslyâ€”design programs that are compatible with U.S. preferences.

This group of small nations, largely unnoticed by the industrialized West, are dropping further and further behind the majority of the world's people, often falling into an absolute decline in living standards. A struggle rages within each of these nation between reformers and corrupt leaders--and the corrupt are winning. Collier analyzes the causes of failure, and offers a bold new plan.--From publisher description},

The review is oriented towards researchers who undertake secondary analyses of large-scale multipurpose social science datasets. The article begins with an outline of two main approaches used in social surveys to measure ethnicity, the â€˜mutually exclusive categoryâ€™ approach and the â€˜multiple characteristicsâ€™ approach. We also describe approaches to the use of ethnicity measures in cross-national comparative research. We emphasise the value of sensitivity analyses. We also encourage researchers to carefully consider the possible relationships between ethnicity and other important variables in order to avoid spurious interpretations of the effects of ethnicity.},

In this article we argue that as innovative as some diplomatic practices of the G20 may be, we should not overstate their potential impact. More specifically, we show that G20 diplomacy often reproduces many oligarchic tendencies in global governance, while also relaxing club dynamics in some ways. On the one hand, the G20 has more inductees who operate along new rules of the game and under a new multilateral ethos of difference. But, on the other hand, the G20 still comprises self-appointed rulers, with arbitrary rules of membership and many processes of cooption and discipline. In overall terms, approaching G20 diplomacy from a practice perspective not only provides us with the necessary analytical granularity to tell the old from the new, it also sheds different light on the dialectics of stability and change on the world stage. Practices are processes and as such they are always subject to evolutionary change. However, because of their structuring effects, diplomatic practices also tend to inhibit global transformation and reproduce the existing order.},

  abstract = {"Data is fundamental to the modern world. From economic development to health care to education and public policy, we rely on numbers to allocate resources and make crucial decisions. But because so much data fails to take into account gender, because it treats men as the default and women as atypical, bias and discrimination are baked into our systems. And women pay tremendous costs for this bias, in time, money, and often with their lives. Celebrated feminist advocate Caroline Criado Perez investigates this shocking root cause of gender inequality in Invisible Women. Examining the home, the workplace, the public square, the doctor's office, and more, Criado Perez unearths a dangerous pattern in data and its consequences on women's lives. Product designers use a 'one-size-fits-all' approach to everything from pianos to cell phones to voice recognition software, when in fact this approach is designed to fit men. Cities prioritize men's needs when designing public transportation, roads, and even snow removal, neglecting to consider women's safety or unique responsibilities and travel patterns. And in medical research, women have largely been excluded from studies and textbooks, leaving them chronically misunderstood, mistreated, and misdiagnosed. Built on hundreds of studies in the US, the UK, and around the world, and written with energy, wit, and sparkling intelligence, this is a groundbreaking, highly readable exposÃ© that will change the way you look at the world"--Jacket},

Using Chinese customs transactions between 2000 and 2009, we exploit time-variation in product-level trade policy and find that Chinese firms are less likely to enter new foreign markets and more likely to exit from established foreign markets when their products are subject to increased trade policy uncertainty. Our analysis is based on the phenomenon of â€œtariff echoingâ€ â€“ after a tariff hike in one country, another country is likely to raise its tariff on the same product. Overall, we find that if there had been no trade policy uncertainty created by the use of contingent tariffs, Chinese entry into foreign markets would have been roughly 2\% higher per year. We use our model to counterfactually estimate how much entry by Chinese firms over 2001â€“2009 was due to future trade policy certainty provided by membership in the WTO.},

Nonetheless I worry that an overemphasis on household and personal Â· sphere fossil fuel emissions distracts from attention to higher-level corporate and governmental responsibilities for addressing the problem of climate change. I argue that more attention should be placed on the higher-level responsibilities of corporations and governments, and I discuss how individuals might more effectively take responsibility for addressing global climate change, especially when corporations and governments refuse to do so.},

Based on National Sample Survey data of India, the analysis finds that income has a low impact, while non-economic factors have an equal or higher impact on access to and use of latrines. The number of household members has a negative impact on both access to and use of latrines. Access to and use of latrines depends on gender, age, and education of the household head. Both access and use also depend on the main occupation, religion, and caste of households. Access to water supply and dwelling materials also impacts access to and use of latrines. Households headed by younger people or those living in hired houses are more likely to access public or common latrines. Access to sanitation also depends on the region and hence the norms and customs of the region. Contrary to expectations, a lesser proportion of households have access to latrines if they own a house versus those who reside in hired dwellings. Quality, cleanliness of latrines and other personal preferences matter in the use of latrines. Public and community toilets for youths, more than one latrine for larger households, and social campaigning are suggested for public policy.},

Infrastructure provision needs to consider both the product (physical services) and the context in which the services will be provided and maintained in order to be sustainable.

ASPIRE toolkit uses qualitative evidence which feeds into 96 indicators producing visual outputs which can encourage users to consider contextual issues and develop valuable trade-offs between the four dimensions. The methodology and toolkit are applied to the evaluation of an infrastructure upgrading project in Korail, Bangladesh. The Urban Partnership for Poverty Reduction Project (UPPRP) in Korail supports a twin-pronged approach of provision of infrastructure (water, sanitation, roads and drainage) improvement through the Slum Improvement Fund and improvement of socio-economic conditions through the Socio-Economic Funds. The ASPIRE assessment allowed the authors to interrogate strengths and weaknesses of the UPPR project thereby demonstrating the value added by ASPIRE. Overall, the project was deemed successful in Korail. Socially, it allowed access to all types of services to the slum's residents with strong community engagement. Land security however was noted to be a challenge, which needs to be addressed by institutions in Dhaka.},

This bias obscures a proper understanding of the developmental causes and consequences of migration at the sending end. The reciprocal migration -- development relationship is examined through the discussion of seven migration 'myths'. Because of its profound developmental roots, it is useless to think that migration can be halted or that aid and trade are short-cut 'solutions' to immigration. Migrant remittances contribute significantly to development and living conditions in sending countries. Nevertheless, the recent 'remittance euphoria' is not justified, because unattractive investment environments and restrictive immigration policies which interrupt circular migration patterns prevent the high development potential of migration from being fully realised. Although specific policies can enhance this potential through facilitating remittance transfers and investments, the key lies in encouraging circular migration. Instead of uselessly and harmfully trying to stop inevitable migration, immigration policies allowing for freer circulation can, besides increasing migration control, enhance the vital contribution of migrants to the development of their home countries.},

This paper argues how such discursive shifts in the migration and development debate should be primarily seen as part of more general paradigm shifts in social and development theory. However, the classical opposition between pessimistic and optimistic views is challenged by empirical evidence pointing to the heterogeneity of migration impacts. By integrating and amending insights from the new economics of labor migration, livelihood perspectives in development studies and transnational perspectives in migration studies â€“ which share several though as yet unobserved conceptual parallels â€“ this paper elaborates the contours of a conceptual framework that simultaneously integrates agency and structure perspectives and is therefore able to account for the heterogeneous nature of migration-development interactions. The resulting perspective reveals the naivety of recent views celebrating migration as self-help development â€œfrom belowâ€. These views are largely ideologically driven and shift the attention away from structural constraints and the vital role of states in shaping favorable conditions for positive development impacts of migration to occur.},

  abstract = {International Relations scholars pay increasing attention to markets as a driver of international cooperation. In international development, market principles pervade donor decision-making about foreign aid allocation and delivery. An important aspect of this trend is that, increasingly, like-minded (as in pro-market) donor governments cooperate to promote market-oriented development policies, while the ones who do not share this view are less likely to engage in this mode of cooperation. In this article, we use network analysis to explore patterns of collaboration between donors through trust funds. These funds are ad-hoc policy venues and financing vehicles hosted by international organizations. They allow like-minded donors to support joint priority areas, while also acting as conduits for policy learning. In a first step, we describe the network of donor cooperation that emerges through the use of joint trust funds and explore how this network varies with different types of funds. We expect that cooperative donor networks are particularly likely to emerge in sectors that allow for easy attribution of results (e.g. education, health, and emergencies) and that adopt private sector principles in their governance. Moreover, trust funds differentially drive international cooperation, depending on the political economy of donor countries. We then test market-based explanations for donor collaboration using ERGM analysis. Our project thus contributes to the study of international cooperation by mapping donor political economies to networks of donor cooperation.},

Bias mitigation strategies often focus on the person, by educating people about their biases, typically with little success. We focus instead on the system, presenting the first evidence that altering the design of an interactive visualization tool can mitigate a strong bias - the attraction effect. Participants viewed 2D scatterplots where choices between superior alternatives were affected by the placement of other suboptimal points. We found that highlighting the superior alternatives weakened the bias, but did not eliminate it. We then tested an interactive approach where participants completely removed locally dominated points from the view, inspired by the elimination by aspects strategy in the decision-making literature. This approach strongly decreased the bias, leading to a counterintuitive suggestion: tools that allow removing inappropriately salient or distracting data from a view may help lead users to make more rational decisions.},

Bearing this in mind, the main goal of this paper is to present an I-distance methodology that holds a new perspective on the measurement of information development, to compare it to the ICT development index (IDI), and to point out improvements that such methodology provides. IDI combines 11 indicators related to three ICT categories: Access, Use and Skills (by weighting the first two by 40 percent and the third by 20 percent). The approach presented in this study uses the same indicators, synthesizing them into one value. Subsequently, which variables are the most relevant for measuring ICT development level of countries are able to be determined. Consequently, the I-distance method provides useful insight into developing countries and ways that enhance their ranking. The results show that the correlation between the I-distance values and IDI values is very strong, r = 0.961, p {$<$} 0.01, which makes I-distance an acceptable measurement method for evaluating countriesâ€™ ICT development levels.},

Water plays an important role in the production of energy, including renewable energy sources and the extraction of unconventional fossil fuels that are expected to become important players in future energy security. The emergent competition for water between the food and energy systems is increasingly recognized in the concept of the â€œfood-energy-water nexus.â€ The nexus between food and water is made even more complex by the globalization of agriculture and rapid growth in food trade, which results in a massive virtual transfer of water among regions and plays an important role in the food and water security of some regions. This review explores multiple components of the food-energy-water nexus and highlights possible approaches that could be used to meet food and energy security with the limited renewable water resources of the planet. Despite clear tensions inherent in meeting the growing and changing demand for food and energy in the 21st century, the inherent linkages among food, water, and energy systems can offer an opportunity for synergistic strategies aimed at resilient food, water, and energy security, such as the circular economy.},

Tracking this finance is particularly problematic for climate change adaptation, as there is no clear definition of what separates adaptation aid from standard development aid. Here we use a historical database of overseas development assistance projects to test the effect of different accounting assumptions on the delivery of adaptation finance to the developing countries of Oceania, using machine algorithms developed from a manual pilot study. The results show that explicit adaptation finance grew to 3\%â€“4\% of all development aid to Oceania by the 2008â€“2012 period, but that total adaptation finance could be as high as 37\% of all aid, depending on potentially politically motivated assumptions about what counts as adaptation. There was also an uneven distribution of adaptation aid between countries facing similar challenges like Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, and the Federated States of Micronesia. The analysis indicates that data allowing individual projects to be weighted by their climate change relevance is needed. A robust and mandatory metadata system for all aid projects would allow multilateral aid agencies and independent third parties to perform their own analyses using different assumptions and definitions, and serve as a key check on international climate aid promises.},

While political considerations shape China's allocation of aid, China does not pay substantially more attention to politics compared to Western donors. What is more, China's aid allocation seems to be widely independent of recipients' endowment with natural resources and institutional characteristics.

This concern assumes that a bureaucrat applies to his tasks the values and interests of his social background. Evidence from Zambia, a country in which ethnic and regional differences have been highly politicized, suggests that this assumption lacks empirical support. The fundamental guidelines that appear to shape administrative behavior in Zambia are the calculations of what must be done to achieve individual career advancement. Administrators are, in addition, constrained from pursuing parochial interests by the range of authority and discretion attached to their particular positions.             Although bureaucrats do not appear to provide ideal representatives for ethnic interests, the ethnic composition of the most visible echelons of the government is of critical political significance. This is particularly evident in a country like Zambia where ethnically defined groups are contending for positions in the new postcolonial society.

Black Americans suffer on nearly every measure of health in relation to white Americans. Five theoretical models have been proposed to explain these disparities: a racial-genetic model, a health-behavior model, a socioeconomic status model, a psychosocial stress model, and a structural-constructivist model. We selectively review literature on health disparities, emphasizing research on low birth weight and high blood pressure. The psychosocial stress model and the structural-constructivist model offer greatest promise to explain disparities. In future research, theoretical elaboration and operational specificity are needed to distinguish among three distinct factors: (a) genetic variants contributing to disease risk; (b) ethnoracial or folk racial categories masquerading as biology; and (c) ethnic group membership. Such elaboration is necessary to move beyond the conflation of these three distinct constructs that characterizes much of current research.},

  abstract = {Cholera, a water-borne bacteria infectious disease, shows clear spatial variation in its transmission pattern. It is thus important to incorporate understanding on the spatial variability of its transmission when making transmission prediction and intervention decisions. However, for an emerging cholera outbreak, transmission dynamics models are often uncertain as model parameters are indeterminate and epidemic state can only be partially observed. Hence, ensuing intervention decisions have to be made under uncertainty and thus the resultant optimization problem is challenging. In this paper, we study a multi-period location-specific resource allocation problem for cholera outbreak intervention with periodically acquired state information from different locations and increasingly understood transmission parameters over time. We formulate the problem as a nonlinear optimization model on a set of ordinary-differential-equations governing location-specific disease transmission dynamics. We propose a data-driven optimization approach to determine the optimal strategy of intervention resource allocation at each period and each community in a rolling-horizon manner. At each period, we integrate single-period model parameter fitting and scenario-based stochastic programming to make decisions under uncertainty with newly acquired system understanding. We conduct comparative studies to assess the performance of our data-driven optimization approach and offer insights into intervention resource allocation policy development. We conclude that our data-driven optimization approach is effective to multi-period decision problems under system dynamics with indeterminate parameters.},

It also discusses several solutions: structural equation modelling, survey data harmonization, big data, and mixed methods. The authors argue that factorial analysis within structural equation modelling invites new possibilities to measure intersections. Survey data harmonization, at a large enough scale, turns into big data with a sufficient number of cases to construct and analyse nuanced intersectional groups. The mixed method approach uses both quantitative data to generalize across populations and qualitative approaches to delve deep into social and political processes that can reveal and explain power structures.},

Nineteenth century statutes relating to land, governance, public health and justice, for example, were essentially premised on the values and philosophies of the European races. In contrast, policies specific to MÃ¤ori were usually introduced to encourage conformity to Western preferences. By the 20th century, although the rationale was inconsistent and frequently unclear, minority ethnicity reporting had become an accepted marker of social wellbeing. Sometimes it was used for political purposes and often as a proxy measure for socio-economic disadvantage. In that regard policies of equality between individuals and needs-based policies have tended to assume that ethnicity and race are significant only in as much as they can be subsumed under universal indicators such as social class, life expectancy and educational achievement. Twenty-first century research, however, has demonstrated that not only is socio-economic status distinguishable from ethnicity, but that universal indicators are insufficient measures of need and outcome for members of different ethnicities. Because race and ethnicity are closely aligned to world views, culture and lifestyle it is inconsistent with the evidence to exclude them from social and economic policies. Increasingly, race and ethnicity are visible characteristics of New Zealand society, and unless policies reflect that reality, diversity will be masked, best outcomes will be compromised, and assimilation will be fostered â€“ as it was in the 19th century.},

This paper addresses this criticism by providing a general rationale of the underlying methodological problem as well as by proposing a specific methodological approach tailored to correcting the arising bias. We illustrate the latter approach by using Austrian data from the Household Finance and Consumption Survey. Specifically, we identify suitable parameter combinations by using a series of maximumâ€likelihood estimates and appropriate goodnessâ€ofâ€fit tests to avoid arbitrariness with respect to the fitting of the Pareto distribution. Our results suggest that the alleged nonâ€observation bias is considerable, accounting for about one quarter of total net wealth in the case of Austria. The method developed in this paper can easily be applied to other countries where survey data on wealth are available.},

There is rent sharing at the firm level due to fair wage preferences of workers, and hence firms with higher profits pay higher wages in equilibrium in order to elicit their workers' full effort. We show that in this framework international trade leads to a self-selection of the best firms into export status, with exporting firms having to pay a wage premium. Aggregate welfare increases, but there is also larger inequality along multiple dimensions: Involuntary unemployment and income inequality between managers and workers increase, and so does inequality within these two subgroups of individuals, as measured by the respective Gini coefficients.},

  abstract = {In recent years suggestions for reforming the provision and financing of infrastructure services in developing countries have focused on private participation. This alternative to public financing is seen as a way both to minimize the inefficiencies of public administration and to avoid the need for external borrowing.In fact, for much of the nineteenth century, infrastructure projects were privately financed and built. This approach, however, did not obviate the need for government intervention and foreign capital. Because of the difficulties of assessing projects, investors were reluctant to commit their funds, and governments turned to subsidies and loan guarantees to encourage investment. Often, however, government intervention only replaced one set of problems with another. Investors with government-guaranteed loans had no incentive to monitor the firm's performanceâ€”a limitation that led to the diversion of funds and frustrated the public interest. This article draws out the implications of this experience for policymakers in developing countries today.},

  abstract = {This paper is motivated by a concern that adaptation and vulnerability research suffer from an under-theorization of the political mechanisms of social change and the processes that serve to reproduce vulnerability over time and space. We argue that adaptation is a socio-political process that mediates how individuals and collectives deal with multiple and concurrent environmental and social changes. We propose that applying concepts of subjectivity, knowledges and authority to the analysis of adaptation focuses attention on this socio-political process. Drawing from vulnerability, adaptation, political ecology and social theory literatures, we explain how power is reproduced or contested in adaptation practice through these three concepts. We assert that climate change adaptation processes have the potential to constitute as well as contest authority, subjectivity and knowledge, thereby opening up or closing down space for transformational adaptation. We expand on this assertion through four key propositions about how adaptation processes can be understood and outline an emergent empirical research agenda, which aims to explicitly examine these propositions in specific social and environmental contexts. We describe how the articles in this special issue are contributing to this nascent research agenda, providing an empirical basis from which to theorize the politics of adaptation. The final section concludes by describing the need for a reframing of adaptation policy, practice and analysis to engage with multiple adaptation knowledges, to question subjectivities inherent in discourses and problem understandings, and to identify how emancipatory subjectivities â€“ and thus the potential for transformational adaptation â€“ can be supported.},

Using a dataset covering more than 400 Paris Club agreements, this paper aims to fill that gap. It provides a comprehensive description of the evolving characteristics of these operations and studies the economic dynamics surrounding them. The progressive introduction of new terms of treatment gradually turned the Paris Club from a mere debt collector into a provider of sequential debt relief. The study finds that more generous restructuring conditions involving nominal relief are associated with higher economic growth. In contrast, agreements including only NPV relief have no positive impact on growth. However, the countries that get these restructuring conditions turn out to be more likely to pursue a prudent fiscal policy after the event than those receiving a nominal haircut. In other words, when deciding upon the type of relief to be granted through debt restructuring, the official sector faces a trade-off between the objectives of stimulating growth and fostering fiscal sustainability.},

Governance is in danger of losing all meaning precisely because it means many things to different people in varied locations. This is especially true in sub-Saharan Africa. Here, the postcolony takes many forms, reflecting the imperial project with painful accuracy. Offering a set of multidisciplinary analyses of governance in different sectors (crisis management, water, food security, universities), in different locales (including the African Union and specific regional contexts from West Africa, Zambia, to South Africa), and from different theoretical approaches (network to adversarial network governance, and beyond), this volume makes a useful addition to the growing debates on 'how to govern'. It steers away from offering a 'correct' definition of governance, or from promoting a particular position on postcoloniality. It gives no conclusion that neatly sums up all the arguments advanced. Instead, readers are invited to draw their own conclusions based on these differing approaches to and analyses of governance in the postcolony. As a robust, critical assessment of power and accountability in the sub-Saharan context, this collection brings together topical case studies that will be a valuable resource for those working in the field of African international relations, public policy, public management and administration.},

These goals can alter power relations, affect the distribution of resources, reorganize national and local priorities, create perverse incentives for performance, and produce narratives that shape thinking and communication.

This issue focuses on SDGs and includes five case studies of this localization process in aid programming in the Valencia, national reporting by Sweden, farming collectives in South Africa, indigenous communities in Australia and New Zealand, and infrastructure development in Ecuador and Pakistan. A sixth paper examines the role of metrics in including Neglected Tropical Diseases in the SDGs. These papers are diverse in the research questions they ask but engage with the common themes of global goals as a tool of global governance and their disruptive effects on power structures. Using the framework of data infrastructureâ€”means of collection and analysis, social structures amongst actors, knowledge systemsâ€”this introduction highlights the insights that emerge.},

In this study, we propose extending the framing approach by incorporating insights from the literature on sensemaking to examine how and when opportunities for meaning creation open up and how this affects subsequent discursive processes. Connecting framing and sensemaking better enables us to examine how structural factors prompt and bound discursive processes, affecting when and where frame contests emerge. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by examining changes in the discourse of globalization. Using qualitative and quantitative analyses of newspaper articles and corporate press releases, we trace the emergence of globalization discourse, its diffusion, and the increasing contention that surrounds it. Our findings show how and where globalization discourse emerged in response to greater U.S. involvement with the international economy, and how later frame contests over the meaning of globalization have depended on the interests of the actors involved.},

To that end, we compare foreign to domestic acquisitions in addition to accounting for the impact of majority versus minority acquisitions after controlling for country and sector trends. The productivity of foreign acquired affiliates increases modestly after four years, but only when majority stakes are acquired by foreigners. Our results are driven by foreign acquisitions and not by foreign divestment.},

After exploring different definitions and dimensions of the two ideas, the more relevant question turns out tobe: what kinds of transparency lead to what kinds of accountability, and under what conditions? The article concludes by proposing that the concept can be unpacked in terms of two distinct variants. Transparency can be either 'clear'or 'opaque', while accountability can be either 'soft'or 'hard'.},

Here we describe and synthesize data sets and methodology to quantify the five major components of the global carbon budget and their uncertainties. Fossil CO\textsubscript{2} emissions (\emph{E}\textsubscript{FOS}) are based on energy statistics and cement production data, while emissions from land-use change (\emph{E}\textsubscript{LUC}), mainly deforestation, are based on land use and land-use change data and bookkeeping models. Atmospheric CO\textsubscript{2} concentration is measured directly and its growth rate (\emph{G}\textsubscript{ATM}) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The ocean CO\textsubscript{2} sink (\emph{S}\textsubscript{OCEAN}) and terrestrial CO\textsubscript{2} sink (\emph{S}\textsubscript{LAND}) are estimated with global process models constrained by observations. The resulting carbon budget imbalance (\emph{B}\textsubscript{IM}), the difference between the estimated total emissions and the estimated changes in the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere, is a measure of imperfect data and understanding of the contemporary carbon cycle. All uncertainties are reported as Â±1\emph{Ïƒ}. For the last decade available (2010â€“2019), \emph{E}\textsubscript{FOS} was 9.6\&thinsp;Â±\&thinsp;0.5\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{âˆ’1} excluding the cement carbonation sink (9.4\&thinsp;Â±\&thinsp;0.5\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{âˆ’1} when the cement carbonation sink is included), and \emph{E}\textsubscript{LUC} was 1.6\&thinsp;Â±\&thinsp;0.7\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{âˆ’1}. For the same decade, \emph{G}\textsubscript{ATM} was 5.1\&thinsp;Â±\&thinsp;0.02\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{âˆ’1} (2.4\&thinsp;Â±\&thinsp;0.01\&thinsp;ppm\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{âˆ’1}), \emph{S}\textsubscript{OCEAN} 2.5\&thinsp;Â±\&thinsp; 0.6\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{âˆ’1}, and \emph{S}\textsubscript{LAND} 3.4\&thinsp;Â±\&thinsp;0.9\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{âˆ’1}, with a budget imbalance \emph{B}\textsubscript{IM} of âˆ’0.1\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{âˆ’1} indicating a near balance between estimated sources and sinks over the last decade. For the year 2019 alone, the growth in \emph{E}\textsubscript{FOS} was only about 0.1\&thinsp;\% with fossil emissions increasing to 9.9\&thinsp;Â±\&thinsp;0.5\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{âˆ’1} excluding the cement carbonation sink (9.7\&thinsp;Â±\&thinsp;0.5\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{âˆ’1} when cement carbonation sink is included), and \emph{E}\textsubscript{LUC} was 1.8\&thinsp;Â±\&thinsp;0.7\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{âˆ’1}, for total anthropogenic CO\textsubscript{2} emissions of 11.5\&thinsp;Â±\&thinsp;0.9\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{âˆ’1} (42.2\&thinsp;Â±\&thinsp;3.3\&thinsp;GtCO\textsubscript{2}). Also for 2019, \emph{G}\textsubscript{ATM} was 5.4\&thinsp;Â±\&thinsp;0.2\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{âˆ’1} (2.5\&thinsp;Â±\&thinsp;0.1\&thinsp;ppm\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{âˆ’1}), \emph{S}\textsubscript{OCEAN} was 2.6\&thinsp;Â±\&thinsp;0.6\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{âˆ’1}, and \emph{S}\textsubscript{LAND} was 3.1\&thinsp;Â±\&thinsp;1.2\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{âˆ’1}, with a \emph{B}\textsubscript{IM} of 0.3\&thinsp;GtC. The global atmospheric CO\textsubscript{2} concentration reached 409.85\&thinsp;Â±\&thinsp;0.1\&thinsp;ppm averaged over 2019. Preliminary data for 2020, accounting for the COVID-19-induced changes in emissions, suggest a decrease in \emph{E}\textsubscript{FOS} relative to 2019 of about âˆ’7\&thinsp;\% (median estimate) based on individual estimates from four studies of âˆ’6\&thinsp;\%, âˆ’7\&thinsp;\%, âˆ’7\&thinsp;\% (âˆ’3\&thinsp;\% to âˆ’11\&thinsp;\%), and âˆ’13\&thinsp;\%. Overall, the mean and trend in the components of the global carbon budget are consistently estimated over the period 1959â€“2019, but discrepancies of up to 1\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{âˆ’1} persist for the representation of semi-decadal variability in CO\textsubscript{2} fluxes. Comparison of estimates from diverse approaches and observations shows (1) no consensus in the mean and trend in land-use change emissions over the last decade, (2) a persistent low agreement between the different methods on the magnitude of the land CO\textsubscript{2} flux in the northern extra-tropics, and (3) an apparent discrepancy between the different methods for the ocean sink outside the tropics, particularly in the Southern Ocean. This living data update documents changes in the methods and data sets used in this new global carbon budget and the progress in understanding of the global carbon cycle compared with previous publications of this data set (Friedlingstein et al., 2019; Le QuÃ©rÃ© et al., 2018b, a, 2016, 2015b, a, 2014, 2013).

Some feminists within and outside the academy treat the gender data revolution with suspicion, likening it to a â€˜measurement obsessionâ€™ (Liebowitz and Zwingel 2014) that is overly quantitative (Buss 2015) and ill-fit to capture the complexities of gender subordination. In this paper, we suggest that feminist geographers as academics and scholar-activists have a unique and important contribution to make to the gender data debate, which at present is largely aspatial. Drawing on empirical examples we first illustrate how feminist geographyâ€™s conceptual and methodological contributions enrich the gender data debate; second, we reflect on the possibilities and limitations of a practical intervention that we are currently staging as co-founders of a feminist research venture that seeks to shape policymaking, critically considering the possibilities and limitations of such an endeavour.},

  abstract = {Fukuda-Parr and Yamin explore the effects of global goal setting on international development agendas and thinking. They present a condensed synthesis of the "Power of Numbers" project, an independent research initiative, led by them, and involving 17 scholars. The project analyzed the influence of MDGs and associated indicators on policy priorities and development narratives, their diverse incentives, and both intended and unintended consequences. The authors recommend that both positive and negative lessons from experience be kept in mind in the design of the post-2015 agendas. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

  abstract = {Global development goals have become increasingly used by the UN and the international community to promote priority objectives. The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are the most prominent example of such goals but many others have been set since the 1960s. Despite their prominence and proliferation, little has been written about the concept of global goals as a policy tool, their effectiveness, limitations and broader consequences. This paper explores global development goals as a policy tool, and the mechanisms that have two types of effects: governance effects and knowledge effects. These effects lead to both intended and unintended consequences in influencing international development strategies and action. The paper analyses the MDGs as an example to argue that global goals activate the power of numbers to create incentives for national governments and others to mobilize for important objectives. But the powers of simplification, reification and abstraction lead to broader unintended consequences when the goals are misinterpreted as national planning targets and strategic agendas, and when they enter the language of development to redefine concepts such as development and poverty.},

  abstract = {We call for strengthening the Global Financial Safety Net (GFSN) to manage the economic effects of the outbreak of COVID-19, in particular the massive capital outflows from emerging market and developing economies and the global shortage of dollar liquidity. Both the United Nations (UN) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimate that emerging market and developing countries (EMDEs) need an immediate \$2.5 trillion, yet the financing available to them is just \$700 to \$971 billion. To meet these immediate needs we propose to: (i) broaden the coverage of the Federal Reserve currency swaps; (ii) issue at least \$500 billion of Special Drawing Rights through the IMF; (iii) improve the IMFâ€™s precautionary and emergency facilities; (iv) establish a multilateral swap facility at the IMF; (v) increase the resources and geographic coverage of Regional Financial Arrangements; (vi) coordinate capital flow management measures; (vii) initiate debt restructuring and relief initiatives; and (viii) request that credit-rating agencies stop making downgrades during the emergency. It argues that beyond these immediate measures, leaders should swiftly move to address the following structural gaps in the GFSN: (i) agree on a quota reform at the IMF; (ii) create an appropriate Sovereign Debt Restructuring Regime; (iii) expand surveillance activity; and (iv) adopt IMF governance reform and strengthen its relations with all agents of the GFSN. All of these immediate and intermediate reforms must be calibrated toward a just transition to a more stable, inclusive, and sustainable global economy.},

  abstract = {The post-global financial crisis world will be increasingly dominated by China and the United States. What the de facto G2 do, together, independently or in conflict, will increasingly define the global bounds of the possible. Both countries want to embed their bilateral diplomacy in the multilateralism of the G20. The problem for the emergent G2 in G20 global architecture is that economic relations between China and the US will be increasingly difficult to manage. The large economic imbalances between the two countries, in which China buys American debt and Americans buy Chinese goods, will endure. Before the crisis, the codependence these imbalances created was a source of stability in Sinoâ€“American relations. After the crisis, they will be a source of frustration and conflict, as the second half of 2009 showed. To manage economic relations between China and the US effectively, the G20 agenda will have to move from crisis management to strategic planning for the global economy. The G20 will also have to become more institutionalized, but in a way that resembles more a nonexecutive board of directors of a multinational firm than a management committee of C-level executives. Policy Implications â€¢ The world will be characterized by a de facto Chinaâ€“US G2 after the financial crisis. â€¢ Despite new commitments from both countries, large-scale Chinaâ€“US economic imbalances will persist. â€¢ Dueling protectionism and economic nationalism are the biggest potential medium-term threats to Chinaâ€“US relations. â€¢ Nesting the de facto G2 in the de jure G20 is the best hope for managing Chinaâ€“US tensions. â€¢ The G20 should be institutionalized as the board of directors for overseeing the Bretton Woods system, not as a replacement for it.},

While some states have already achieved coverage of 90\% or more, in others the proportion served is as low as 22\%. There are also wide disparities between urban and rural households. Overall, more than 81.4\% of urban households, but only 30.7\% of rural households have a latrine. The difference varies widely across the country. Coverage has increased by 10.5\% over the decade from 2001. This progress also varied widely between states and between districts within each state; 6.3\% of districts made negative progress during that period. The variation between states and districts means that some have already achieved the Millennium Development Goal of halving the proportion of their population that lacks sanitation, while others, if they continue at the present rate, will not do so for many decades. Study of the causes of these differences offers the hope of finding ways to accelerate progress in the laggard states and districts. For example, we find a close association between district sanitation coverage and female literacy, suggesting an important role for education.},

It is usually presented as the intersection between environment, society and economy, which are conceived of as separate although connected entities. We would argue that these are not unified entities: rather they are fractured and multi-layered and can be considered at different spatial levels. The economy is often given priority in policies and the environment is viewed as apart from humans. They are interconnected, with the economy dependent on society and the environment while human existence and society are dependent on, and within the environment. The separation of environment, society and economy often leads to a narrow techno-scientific approach, while issues to do with society that are most likely to challenge the present socio-economic structure are often marginalized, in particular the sustainability of communities and the maintenance of cultural diversity.

  abstract = {The global community is committed to addressing malnutrition. And yet, coverage data for high-impact interventions along the continuum of care remain scarce due to several measurement and data collection challenges. In this analysis paper, we identify 24 nutrition interventions that should be tracked by all countries, and determine if their coverage is currently measured by major household nutrition and health surveys. We then present three case studies, using published literature and empirical data from large-scale initiatives, to illustrate the kind of data collection innovations that are feasible. We find that data are not routinely collected in a standardised way across countries for most of the core set of interventions. Case studiesâ€”of growth monitoring and screening for acute malnutrition, infant and young child feeding counselling, and nutrition monitoring in Indiaâ€”highlight both challenges and potential solutions. Advancing the nutrition intervention coverage measurement agenda is essential for sustained progress in driving down rates of malnutrition. It will require (1) global consensus on a core set of validated coverage indicators on proven, high-impact nutrition-specific interventions; (2) the inclusion of coverage measurement and indicator guidance in WHO intervention recommendations; (3) the incorporation of these indicators into data collection mechanisms and relevant intervention delivery platforms; and (4) an agenda for continuous measurement improvement.},

  abstract = {Strategic planning and appropriate development and management of water and sanitation services are strongly supported by accurate and accessible data. If adequately exploited, these data might assist water managers with performance monitoring, benchmarking comparisons, policy progress evaluation, resources allocation, and decision making. A variety of tools and techniques are in place to collect such information. However, some methodological weaknesses arise when developing an instrument for routine data collection, particularly at local level: i) comparability problems due to heterogeneity of indicators, ii) poor reliability of collected data, iii) inadequate combination of different information sources, and iv) statistical validity of produced estimates when disaggregated into small geographic subareas. This study proposes an improved approach for water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) data collection at decentralised level in low income settings, as an attempt to overcome previous shortcomings. The ultimate aim is to provide local policymakers with strong evidences to inform their planning decisions. The survey design takes the Water Point Mapping (WPM) as a starting point to record all available water sources at a particular location. This information is then linked to data produced by a household survey. Different survey instruments are implemented to collect reliable data by employing a variety of techniques, such as structured questionnaires, direct observation and water quality testing. The collected data is finally validated through simple statistical analysis, which in turn produces valuable outputs that might feed into the decision-making process. In order to demonstrate the applicability of the method, outcomes produced from three different case studies (Homa Bay District â€“Kenyaâ€“; Kibondo District â€“Tanzaniaâ€“; and Municipality of ManhiÃ§a â€“Mozambiqueâ€“) are presented.},

The analysis is conducted on a sample of 112 countries over the period 2002â€“2015, using the two-step system Generalized Methods of Moments. It shows that AfT programmes are conducive to employment diversification across the agriculture, industry and services sectors in recipient-countries, although this effect could vary across different sub-samples. Additionally, there is a positive effect of the cumulative AfT flows on sectoral employment diversification, with the highest positive effect being on low-income countries.},

  abstract = {Leaders of the Group of 20 (G20) countries, representing 85 percent of the global economy, met by videoconference on March 26 to discuss the international response to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated economic disruptions. This yearâ€™s G20 host, Saudi Arabia, issued a 20-paragraph communiquÃ© on behalf of the group following the call. In it, leaders committed to doing â€œwhatever it takesâ€ to overcome the pandemic and laid out a number of individual and collective actions to address the health crisis, bolster the global economy, and assist countries in distress. However, the statement lacked concrete proposals, and questions remain about the extent to which major economies are committed to following through with a concerted international response to the crisis. Q1: Did the G20 live up to its billing as the premier forum for international economic cooperation? A1: No, certainly by comparison with the G20â€™s forceful role in the 2008-2009 global financial crisis. Leadersâ€™ commitment in the March 26 communiquÃ© to do â€œwhatever it takesâ€ to minimize the economic and social damage from the pandemic was a useful statement of shared purpose. However, the communiquÃ© essentially recounted and endorsed what national governments and central banks are already doing individually through aggressive fiscal and monetary policy. Despite early press reports suggesting injection of a new \$5 trillion in spending, this figure was merely an aggregation of existing measures by G20 countries. Nor did leaders provide any new framing of the economic challenges posed by the health crisis or offer guidance to policymakersâ€”whether in individual countries or in international organizations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or World Bankâ€”on additional measures needed. Q2: Where specifically did the G20 communiquÃ© fall short? A2: The communiquÃ©â€™s language on the health dimensions of the crisis largely repeats prior commitments to strengthen capacities to respond to potential infectious disease outbreaks, increase epidemic preparedness spending, and assess gaps in pandemic preparedness. There is good news in the tasking of the World Health Organization (WHO) to report on gaps in pandemic preparedness to a joint meeting of finance and health ministers, building on existing WHO work to foster such dialogues. That future meeting will bring together officials in charge of the health response with those in charge of the economic and financial response, recognizing the reality that sustainably addressing the economic fallout will depend on addressing its root cause , the pandemic itself. A further positive outcome would entail sustained investment in health-security preparedness, addressing a gap that long predates the current crisis. Engagement with the international financial institutions is another area where the virtual meeting made progress but failed to inspire with specific commitments. On the eve of the virtual meeting, the heads of the IMF and World Bank issued a statement asking â€œall official bilateral creditors to suspend debt payments from IDA [International Development Association] countries that request forbearance.â€ While G20 leaders made no such commitment, they did announce a forthcoming â€œaction planâ€ to deliver international financial assistance, at least opening the door to future bilateral debt relief. Other proposals, including calls for a fresh allocation of the IMFâ€™s â€œspecial drawing rights,â€ were not mentioned in the communiquÃ© but could be forthcoming. The brief section of the communiquÃ© on trade contained few new commitments and several caveats. It began with the phrase, â€œConsistent with the needs of our citizens,â€ which is code in such documents for individual countries to do whatever serves their national interests. The trade language also implicitly gave license to countries to impose restrictions on exports of medical supplies, food, and other critical supplies provided these are justified as â€œemergency measuresâ€ that are targeted and temporary. There was no explicit commitment to avoid protectionism or reduce tariffs and other barriers to trade. Energy is another area of missed opportunity. The G20 includes the three largest energy producers in the world: Saudi Arabia, Russia, and the United States. Two of the three have been openly sparring, pushing energy prices to record lows. While a specific commitment to cut back on production was not likely to be forthcoming, the absence of any language on energy suggests that the scope for cooperative approaches in the G20 is limited. Q3: What do the outcomes of the G20 meeting say about the current effectiveness of multilateral cooperation? A3: Unlike the early G20 leadersâ€™ communiquÃ©s during the global financial crisis in 2008-2009, the G20â€™s March 26 statement fails to convey a spirit of robust internationalism and multilateral cooperation. It is short on new actions and commitments. Despite the aggressive fiscal and monetary policy responses by individual countries, in this case, the whole is less than the sum of its parts. The limited results reflect various fissures in the G20. Most important are the tensions between the groupâ€™s two largest members, the United States and China. In 2008-2009, Washington and Beijing were able to overcome their differences and find common cause in responding forcefully to the global financial crisis. With recent disputes over trade, technology, and other issues already casting a shadow over the relationship, a war of words between Washington and Beijing over the origins of the current pandemic has effectively undermined any residual willingness of the two sides to work together. The U.S.-China differences have also driven a further wedge between Washington and its closest allies. The G20 communiquÃ© came a day after G7 foreign ministers could not agree on a joint statement because of reported U.S. insistence on labeling COVID-19 the â€œWuhan virus,â€ which other G7 countries saw as unnecessarily antagonistic to China. Until these fissures among major economies are healed, multilateral cooperation to address the pandemic and its associated economic disruptions is likely to continue to fall short. Matthew P.

How a country fares in these assessments has come to signify not only how a nationâ€™s education system is performing, but also its future prospects in a global economic â€˜raceâ€™. These assessments provoke passionate arguments at specialist conferences and in scholarly journals and they are just as passionately debated in the media. Within academe, ILSAs are researched by sociologists and psychometricians, policy experts and statisticians. This multidisciplinary, multi-voice discussion has not always served to highlight the complexity of the issues involved. Instead, discussions across various groups of actors have often led to a polarisation of views and a hardening of stances. Large-scale comparisons have deeply divided academic opinion with regard to their validity, usefulness and use. The divergence in ontological commitments, methodologies and paradigms of research makes discussions among one set of scholars almost incomprehensible to another. New theories, concepts and vocabularies are urgently required to engage productively with this important phenomenon. Borrowing concepts from Science and Technology Studies (STS) and the history and sociology of numbers, I argue that understanding such comparative exercises as socio-technical assemblages would move the critique of large-scale comparisons in education in more productive directions.},

However, due to the duty of loyalty to which civil servants of the European Union submit, these policies only satisfy the criterion of passive representation.

We find that when we introduce trade, increases in trade volumes, both in terms of imports and exports, cause reductions in the level of derived labour demand. When we disaggregate by origin of imports we find stronger effects in trade with the EU and US compared to trade with East Asia. This provides supportive evidence for the idea that trade affects x-inefficiency, with the strongest competition for UK manufacturers coming from producers in the EU and US.},

In the literature, ethnicity is frequently assumed to be the cultural identity of a group within a nation state while race is assumed to be the biological and/or cultural essentialization/naturalization of a group based on a hierarchy of superiority and inferiority related to the biological constitution of their bodies. It is posited that, depending on the context of power relations involved, there are â€˜racialized ethnicitiesâ€™ and/or â€˜ethnicized races.â€™ The racialization of Puerto Rican identity in New York City is an example of the former and the use of racial categories such as â€˜blackâ€™ as an ethnic identity is an example of the latter. By using the notion of coloniality of power, this article attempts to justify the use of the notion â€˜racial/ethnic identityâ€™ rather than using these concepts as separate or autonomous categories.},

By combining the PIAAC-based skills indicators with OECD Trade in Value Added (TiVA) data, light is shed on the way skills and their distributions (at the country-industry level) relate to industry performance and to integration into global value chains (GVCs). The results underline the importance of cognitive skills such as literacy, numeracy and problem solving for any industry to thrive in the global economy. Also, a persistent and positive association with labour productivity and participation in GVCs is observed, at the industry level, for non-cognitive skills such as managing and communication skills, ICT skills and workersâ€™ readiness to learn and to think creatively.},

Changes in international production systems are examined with particular attention given to four key sectors heavily integrated into global value chains (GVCs): Textiles and Apparel; Chemicals; ICT and Electronics; and, Motor Vehicles. Some insights into the roles played by services sectors and non-residentsâ€™ expenditure and, the employment and environmental impacts of GVCs, are also provided. Considerable heterogeneity across countries and regions is revealed, particularly for East and Southeast Asian where China plays a key role. Services are increasingly important for manufactured exporting activities as well as for countries wishing to â€œupgradeâ€ their activities to higher value added stages of production. Taking a consumption perspective suggests that national efforts to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions could be affected by international outsourcing of production.},

The author states her intention to explore some of the theoretical and practical dilemmas of researching "race" and ethnicity. This is, without question, achieved. I recommend it as essential reading for those concerned with increasing their awareness of issues relating to race, ethnicity and research practice' - Nurse Researcher  'This is a thought-provoking and challenging book which demonstrated the fractured and fluid nature of difference and power in the research process. Importantly it offers a guide to the ways in which research can be effectively and productively used in challenging the status quo' - Diversity in Health and Social Care  Researching `Race' and Ethnicity provides an innovative discussion of the methodological, epistemological and ethical challenges of doing qualitative research that is informed by questions of `race', ethnicity and social difference. By identifying and challenging `categorical thinking' and many longstanding assumptions about the meanings of `race' and ethnicity, the author gets to the heart of many of the everyday dilemmas and difficulties that researchers confront in the field, but are rarely theorised or openly discussed.  Yasmin Gunaratnam's insistence that `race' and ethnicity are a significant part of all qualitative research, and are not the `specialist' concerns of those whose work is explicitly focussed upon `race', provokes a radical rethinking of current methological debates. How do racial and ethnic categories inform our approaches to research? How does the racialised indentity of the researcher and the research participants affect the research interaction and the knowledge that we produce? What are the assumptions that are made about racialised subjectivity and inter-subjectivity? How can we make sense of accounts in which `race' and ethnicity are silent or are non-manifest? How can we work ethically across difference?  In examining these and other questions, the wide-ranging discussions in the book are animated by examples drawn from the author's ethnographic research with white and minoritized research participants. Through these examples readers will be able to engage with some of the complexities of research relationships, power relations and ethical concerns about engagement, disconnection and complicity in research. The attention that the book gives to the excluded experiences of minoritized researchers will be of particular value to many readers.  Researching `Race' and Ethnicity is essential reading for students and academics in the social sciences.},

However, in the eyes of many water experts, SDG 6 indicators are far from perfect. It is important to systematically identify and prioritise the gaps and weaknesses in the SDG 6 indicator framework to address them effectively. This paper identifies two potential gaps: first, between the aspirations captured in SDG 6 targets and what will be measured by the relevant indicators; and second, between what is being measured in â€˜means of implementationâ€™ indicators and what the key means of implementation achievements of many countries are expected to be under SDG 6. Three existing mechanismsâ€”complementary indicators, international support and an integrated approachâ€”are briefly described, and it is proposed that they may potentially be harnessed to assist national governments to address the two types of gaps identified for SDG 6. There is also an opportunity for stakeholders to help erase the gaps in a comprehensive review of SDG indicators, though how open and participatory the full review process will be is not yet clear.},

Many have generated self-reported emission inventories, but their value to emissions mitigation depends on their accuracy, which remains untested. Here, we compare self-reported inventories from 48 US cities to independent estimates from the Vulcan carbon dioxide emissions data product, which is consistent with atmospheric measurements. We found that cities under-report their own greenhouse gas emissions, on average, by 18.3\% (range: âˆ’145.5\% to +63.5\%) â€“ a difference which if extrapolated to all U.S. cities, exceeds Californiaâ€™s total emissions by 23.5\%. Differences arise because city inventories omit particular fuels and source types and estimate transportation emissions differently. These results raise concerns about self-reported inventories in planning or assessing emissions, and warrant consideration of the new urban greenhouse gas information system recently developed by the scientific community.},

Further to that, a preliminary set of 330 indicators was introduced in March 2015. Some SDGs build on preceding Millennium Development Goals while others incorporate new ideas. A critical review has revealed that indicators of varied quality (in terms of the fulfilment certain criteria) have been proposed to assess sustainable development. Despite the fact that there is plenty of theoretical work on quality standards for indicators, in practice users cannot often be sure how adequately the indicators measure the monitored phenomena. Therefore we stress the need to operationalise the Sustainable Development Goalsâ€™ targets and evaluate the indicatorsâ€™ relevance, the characteristic of utmost importance among the indicatorsâ€™ quality traits. The current format of the proposed SDGs and their targets has laid a policy framework; however, without thorough expert and scientific follow up on their operationalisation the indicators may be ambiguous. Therefore we argue for the foundation of a conceptual framework for selecting appropriate indicators for targets from existing sets or formulating new ones. Experts should focus on the â€œindicator-indicated factâ€ relation to ensure the indicatorsâ€™ relevance in order for clear, unambiguous messages to be conveyed to users (decision- and policy-makers and also the lay public). Finally we offer some recommendations for indicators providers in order to contribute to the tremendous amount of conceptual work needed to lay a strong foundation for the development of the final indicators framework.},

These are important demonstrations of the international community's on-going efforts to shift more power to those affected by disasters and to help ensure their dignity throughout the response and recovery efforts. This paper takes these commitments and applies them to the international humanitarian response following TC Pam in Vanuatu to gain greater insight into the implementation of these high-level goals. TC Pam caused massive damage as it tracked across Vanuatu in March 2015 and is still the largest tropical cyclone on record in the south Pacific. This paper clarifies the following contributions: USD 37.04 m to the response efforts, and USD 147.45 m to the on-going recovery from the tropical cyclone. It documents where that money came from, where it went, and what impact it has had to date using only publicly available data. The paper proceeds with analysis of the level of transparency and accountability to the people and communities affected by the disaster, rather than to foreign donors. This analysis shows relatively high transparency of financial flows during the response phase, but low transparency in the recovery phase. Furthermore, there is little evidence of accountability to affected populations through the transparency of information about the impact of the aid provided following TC Pam. This paper concludes with some recommendations to increase financial transparency and broader accountability following disasters.},

  abstract = {An analysis of glossaries of definitions from the grey literature revealed no universally accepted definition for migrant at an international level, with definitions varying by length of stay in a country, documentation/residency or reason for migration. The IOM has acknowledged that no universally accepted definition exists and has stated that â€œthe term migrant was usually understood to cover all cases where the decision to migrate was taken freely by the individual concerned for reasons of â€˜personal convenienceâ€™ and without intervention of an external compelling factorâ€ (168). Within organizations such as the United Nations, definitions have changed over time. In 1953, the United Nations Recommendations on statistics of international migration defined permanent immigrants as â€œnon-residents (both nationals and aliens) arriving with the intention to remain for a period exceeding one yearâ€; the revised Recommendations in 1998 removed the reference to length of stay and defined an international migrant as â€œany person who changes his/her country of usual residenceâ€ (172). The word alien, meaning not a citizen, is commonly used in national legislation dealing with citizenship and residence (e.g. the 1935 Alien Act in Ireland or more recently the 1998 Alien Act in Estonia). The UNHCR distinguishes between the causes of migration and refers to migrants only in the context of those who choose to move and are not forced to move because of a direct threat of persecution or death (170,173). At a European level, the European Migration Network (EMN) (see Case study 1) refers to residency and length of stay, defining a migrant in the EU context either as someone who establishes their usual residence in an EU Member State for at least 12 months, having previously been usually resident in another Member State or non-EU country, or as someone having previously been usually resident in a Member State who ceases to have their usual residence in that State for a period of at least 12 months (171).},

It is shown that aid in all likelihood increases the growth rate, and this result is not conditional on â€˜goodâ€™ policy. There are, however, decreasing returns to aid, and the estimated effectiveness of aid is highly sensitive to the choice of estimator and the set of control variables. When investment and human capital are controlled for, no positive effect of aid is found. Yet, aid continues to impact on growth via investment. We conclude by stressing the need for more theoretical work before this kind of cross-country regression is used for policy purposes.},

The international monetary system is strained, with crisis just around the corner, yet reform is not on anyone\&rsquo;s agenda. Meanwhile China, deeply invested in the current system, faces narrowing options as trading partners question its moves abroad, debt levels rise at home, and its current account moves from surplus to deficit. RMB internationalization might appear to provide a way out, but the policy has its limits and tends to exacerbate rather than relieve tensions. We argue that a tension-reducing solution is at hand to the problems of both the international monetary system and China\&mdash;IMF-style Special Drawing Rights (SDRs). If in a unilateral initiative China were to make the SDR central to its next phase of capital account opening, China\&rsquo;s institutions, corporates and individuals\&mdash;presently restricted in their access to international currency\&mdash;would likely embrace it. Begun by China, with support from the international community and Hong Kong, promulgation of the SDR would usher in an era of lower tensions, providing space for development and avoidance of conflict within a reordered monetary system in which China would have a more prominent role.},

  abstract = {Rationale Open defecation is connected to poor health and child mortality, but billions of people still do not have access to safe sanitation facilities. Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) promotes latrine construction to eradicate open defecation. However, the mechanisms by which CLTS works and how they can be improved remain unknown. The present study is the first to investigate the psychosocial determinants of CLTS in a longitudinal design. Furthermore, we tested whether CLTS can be made more effective by theory- and evidence-based interventions using the risks, attitudes, norms, abilities, and selfregulation (RANAS) model. Methods A cluster-randomized controlled trial of 3216 households was implemented in rural Ghana. Communities were randomly assigned to classic CLTS, one of three RANAS-based interventions, or to the control arm. Prepost surveys at 6-month follow-up included standardized interviews assessing psychosocial determinants from the RANAS model. Regression analyses and multilevel mediation models were computed to test intervention effects and mechanisms of CLTS. Results Latrine coverage increased pre-post by 67.6\% in all intervention arms and by 7.9\% in the control arm (p~{$<~$}.001). The combination with RANAS-based interventions showed non-significantly greater effects than CLTS alone. The effects of CLTS on latrine construction were significantly mediated by changes in four determinants: others' behaviour and approval, self-efficacy, action planning and commitment. Changes in vulnerability, severity, and barrier planning were positively connected to latrine construction but not affected by CLTS. Conclusion This study corroborates the effectiveness of CLTS in increasing latrine coverage, and additional activities can be improved further. Behaviour change techniques within CLTS that strengthened the relevant factors should be maintained. The study also recommends interventions based on the RANAS approach to improve CLTS. Further research is needed to understand the effects of RANAS-based interventions combined with CLTS at longer follow-up},

At the same time, the well-known caveats of the Big Data debate, such as privacy concerns and human resource scarcity, are aggravated in developing countries by long-standing structural shortages in the areas of infrastructure, economic resources and institutions. The result is a new kind of digital divide: a divide in the use of data-based knowledge to inform intelligent decision-making. The article systematically reviews several available policy options in terms of fostering opportunities and minimising risks.},

The first section covers the history of the field (commenting on significant events, policies, and other factors that have shaped health over the years), dominant ideologies, key governmental and nongovernmental organizations, measures and patterns of disease, and social determinants of health. The next section focuses on health economics, a comparison of healthcare systems in different countries, and the impact of crisis conditions (eg, war, terrorism) and environmental changes on health. The final chapters address ethical considerations for global health work and a way forward for the field.},

In broad terms, the concept of sustainable development is an attempt to combine growing concerns about a range of environmental issues with socio-economic issues. To aid understanding of these different policies this paper presents a classification and mapping of different trends of thought on sustainable development, their political and policy frameworks and their attitudes towards change and means of change. Sustainable development has the potential to address fundamental challenges for humanity, now and into the future. However, to do this, it needs more clarity of meaning, concentrating on sustainable livelihoods and well-being rather than well-having, and long term environmental sustainability, which requires a strong basis in principles that link the social and environmental to human equity.

These indicators were developed, as a complement to Trade in Value Added (TiVA) indicators, to provide broad insights into the impact of GVCs on labour markets.

Subsequently, it reviews â€˜â€˜whoâ€™â€™ is chronically poor, â€˜â€˜whyâ€™â€™ they stay poor and what is known about policies to reduce chronic poverty. Despite the limited knowledge available it is clear that hundreds of millions of people are chronically poor, the causes are multifarious but can be analyzed through livelihoods frameworks and that the scale and nature of chronic poverty will require an increase in the levels of financing allocated to social protection in developing countries. Recent conceptual and methodological advances, and the increasing availability of panel datasets, mean that the analysis of deprivation can move on from poverty trends to poverty dynamics.},

Production processes increasingly involve a sequential, vertical trading chain stretching across many countries, with each country specializing in particular stages of a goodâ€™s production sequence. We document a key aspect of these vertical linkages â€” the use of imported inputs in producing goods that are exported â€” which we call vertical specialization. Using inputâ€“output tables from 10 OECD and four emerging market countries we calculate that vertical specialization accounts for 21\% of these countriesâ€™ exports, and grew almost 30\% between 1970 and 1990. We also find that growth in vertical specialization accounts for 30\% of the growth in these countriesâ€™ exports.},

  abstract = {Official development finance from China has risen tremendously in the past two decades across the globe, including in the worldâ€™s poorest continent Africa. How has this sudden increase in development resources affected the two major multilateral development banks (MDBs) in the region, the World Bank and the African Development Bank (AfDB)? One might expect that the MDBs would compete with China to maintain influence in Africa. This study uses statistical tests and interviews with government officials in three recipient countries to see if this is the case. The results indicate that total MDB finance by country change little over time in response to Chinese activity. The sectoral allocation of concessional lending to the poorer countries does not show any responsiveness either. In contrast, shifts in levels and sector allocation can be observed for non-concessional countries. Overall, the study suggests that while Chinaâ€™s role in African development finance is indeed substantial and growing, it has not had the â€œgame changingâ€ impact on traditional development finance as popular perception might lead one to believe. This may change, however, once more recipient countries develop economically and move to non-concessional lending.},

The cumulative economic freedom index show us how open and business friendly a country is. The sub-indices show us openness across different sector of the economy, for example, the financial sector or the trade sector etc. Traditional neo-classical economic theories have explained economic growth looking at the supply of labor, capital and state of technology, with little attention being paid to institutional factors. The study presents evidence based on two panel data-sets. The first set consists of 186 countries over the period 2013, 2014 and 2015 that show institutional factors play a crucial role in economic growth. A second data-set with data for 57 countries for the period 2004â€“2014 also show a positive impact on the index on the growth rate of per capita GDP.},

We find two interesting results over the study period ranging from December 1993 to July 2019. First, there exists asymmetric spillovers and connectedness among the considered exchange rates when trade policy uncertainty is present. Second, the volatility spillover is stronger than the return connectedness between exchange rate and trade policy uncertainty. These findings are robust to the presence of economic policy uncertainty effects. Concomitantly, the trade policy uncertainty patterns are also found to be useful for predicting currency market dynamics. Our findings contribute to the debate on the impact of trade policy uncertainty on the global economy and financial sector.},

The pandemic is negatively affecting global economic growth beyond anything experienced in nearly a century. Estimates so far indicate the virus could trim global economic growth by 3.0\% to 6.0\% in 2020, with a partial recovery in 2021, assuming there is not a second wave of infections. The economic fallout from the pandemic raises the risks of a global economic recession with levels of unemployment not experienced since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The human costs in terms of lives lost will permanently affect global economic growth in addition to the cost of rising levels of poverty, lives upended, careers derailed, and increased social unrest. Global trade could also fall by 18\%, depending on the depth and extent of the global economic downturn, exacting an especially heavy economic toll on trade-dependent developing and emerging economies. The full impact will not be known until the effects of the pandemic peak. This report provides an overview of the global economic costs to date and the response by governments and international institutions to address these effects.},

The differences in ethno-religion and patriarchal social norms embedded in the various cultures to which these female heads belong also create extra challenges when analysing female headship and poverty. This study, which investigates the poverty and expenditure inequality by gender of the head of the household in Sri Lanka, has a special focus on Sinhala and Tamil ethnic groups. This article makes a significant contribution to the literature on horizontal inequalities in FHHs across communities. Our results indicate that, while FHHs show a higher prevalence of poverty than their male counterparts in both Sinhala and Tamil households, the Tamil FHHs are more vulnerable to poverty.},

It then explores a number of new financial instruments and their possible impact on the future shape multilateralism takes in the UN system. The article concludes with some thoughts on financing for a new multilateralism.

  abstract = {The UN High Level Panel has called for a data revolution. The worldâ€™s population should be counted, measured, weighed, and evaluated. This information should be collected, compiled, aggregated, and presented in such a form that it can usefully inform policy-makers and citizens in aggregated forms, and disaggregated according to region, village, gender, and population group. It is tempting to think that having more and better information will improve policy choices, but this is not automatic. Moreover, demanding more information may lead to a deteriorating supply of information if demand outstrips supply. This article therefore focuses on the cost of the data revolution rather than its possible benefits. The simple starting point is that data do have a cost. The cost of the data revolution will be considerable. The costs include the sheer financial cost of monitoring, but importantly extend to include the opportunity cost of competing demands on survey capacity. Particular indicators also influence behavior by skewing activities in favor of completing goals with quantifiable targets. More data are only better data if they contain meaningful information that clearly outweighs the opportunity cost related to its gathering. However, funding available for sustainable development goal (SDG) measurement is limited and there are also institutional capacity limits to be reckoned with. On 11 March 2016, the United Nations Statistical Commissionâ€™s Interagency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs) agreed on 230 individual indicators to monitor the 17 goals and 169 targets. Because the final list of 230 indicators has been a moving target, the research for this article took as the starting point of what a reasonable level of measurement of the millennium development goals would have cost to raise a debate and to give a crude estimate over the cost of the introduction of the SDGs, with their exponential increased demand for data. This is done by bringing together and reconciles the existing information on the costs measurement as a reference for scholars concerned with SDG feasibility and operationalization.},

This important work is complicated by the multiple approaches and tools for assessing food security. In response, we have prepared a compendium and review of food security assessment tools in which we review issues of terminology, measurement, and validation. We begin by describing the evolving definition of food security and use this discussion to frame a review of the current landscape of measurement tools available for assessing food security. We critically assess the purpose/s of these tools, the domains of food security assessed by each, the conceptualizations of food security that underpin each metric, as well as the approaches that have been used to validate these metrics. Specifically, we describe measurement tools that 1) provide national-level estimates of food security, 2) inform global monitoring and early warning systems, 3) assess household food access and acquisition, and 4) measure food consumption and utilization. After describing a number of outstanding measurement challenges that might be addressed in future research, we conclude by offering suggestions to guide the selection of appropriate food security metrics.},

We consider a model where firms differ in their productivity and workers are differentiated by skill as well as gender. A reduction in tariffs induces more productive firms to modernize their technology and enter the export market. New technologies involve computerized production processes and lower the need for physically demanding skills. As a result, the relative wage and employment of women improves in blue-collar tasks, but not in white-collar tasks. We test our model using a panel of establishment level data from Mexico exploiting tariff reductions associated with the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Consistent with our theory we find that tariff reductions caused new firms to enter the export market, update their technology and replace male blue-collar workers with female blue-collar workers.},

Contemporary trade agreements, however, often reach beyond trade in the narrow sense. Consequently, factors unrelated to free trade may affect citizensâ€™ evaluations of these agreements. We propose a model of attitude formation toward specific trade agreements that includes the societal context as a constitutive feature. We expect salient aspects of an agreement to activate corresponding predispositions. Empirically, we compare how this contextual model and a standard model perform in explaining German citizensâ€™ attitudes toward free trade and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). The results show that the standard model performs well in explaining public opinion on the principle of free trade but is less useful in explaining attitudes toward TTIP. The latter were driven by postures toward transatlantic cooperation, predispositions toward the role of interest groups in politics, and market regulation â€“ aspects salient in German public discourse about TTIP. In sum, we find ample evidence for the need to differentiate between the two attitude objects and for our contextual model of attitude formation.},

A wide gap separates this processual understanding of empowerment from the more instrumentalist forms of advocacy which have required the measurement and quantification of empowerment. The ability to exercise choice incorporates three interrelated dimensions: resources (defined broadly to include not only access, but also future claims, to both material and human and social resources); agency (including processes of decision making, as well as less measurable manifestations of agency such as negotiation, deception and manipulation); and achievements (well-being outcomes). A number of studies of women's empowerment are analysed to make some important methodological points about the measurement of empowerment. The paper argues that these three dimensions of choice are indivisible in determining the meaning of an indicator and hence its validity as a measure of empowerment. The notion of choice is further qualified by referring to the conditions of choice, its content and consequences. These qualifications represent an attempt to incorporate the structural parameters of individual choice in the analysis of women's empowerment.},

  abstract = {A detailed examination of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals and the shift in governance strategy they represent. In September 2015, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Sustainable Development Goals as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The Sustainable Development Goals built on and broadened the earlier Millennium Development Goals, but they also signaled a larger shift in governance strategies. The seventeen goals add detailed content to the concept of sustainable development, identify specific targets for each goal, and help frame a broader, more coherent, and transformative 2030 agenda. The Sustainable Development Goals aim to build a universal, integrated framework for action that reflects the economic, social, and planetary complexities of the twenty-first century. This book examines in detail the core characteristics of goal setting, asking when it is an appropriate governance strategy and how it differs from other approaches; analyzes the conditions under which a goal-oriented agenda can enable progress toward desired ends; and considers the practical challenges in implementation.

It uses the Autoregressive Distributed Lag bounds test to cointegration and the Toda and Yamamoto Granger causality tests. The results show that trade openness has positive effects on economic growth both in the short and long run. Furthermore, they reveal a positive and strong complementary relationship between trade openness and capital formation in promoting economic growth.},

In this paper, we create a framework that specifies the conditions that affect whether passive representation results in active representation for sex and then test this framework using the case of education. We find that passive representation of women in education leads to active representation and that the institutional context affects the extent to which this link between passive and active representation occurs.},

Many of these new indicators are short-lived efforts to grab attention and are unlikely to matter much. But we believe there are good reasons to think that some GPIs affect important areas of state policy. Indeed, we argue that GPIs should be thought of increasingly as tools of global governance, involving rule-making and the exercise of soft power on a global scale and that their proliferation constitutes a profound social trend with implications for governance world-wide and reflects the diversity of actors and institutions attempting to influence policies across and among states. This article defines what we mean by global performance indicators, and describes their features. Using a new dataset and a series of interviews with producers of various indices, we document the proliferation of GPIs, which have been developed and promulgated by a wide range of actors, both public and private; unilaterally and multilaterally. We then elaborate possible causal mechanisms that we expect to connect externally generated GPIs with state policy, and hypothesize about the scope conditions for their effects.},

Systematic monitoring allows for the creation of numerical indicators that can be used to rank, compare, and essentially censure states. This article argues that the ability to disseminate such numerical indicators widely and instantly constitutes an exercise of social power, with the potential to change important policy outputs. It explores this argument in the context of the United Statesâ€™ efforts to combat trafficking in persons and find evidence that monitoring has important effects: Countries are more likely to criminalize human trafficking when they are included in the U.S. annual Trafficking in Persons Report, and countries that are placed on a â€œwatch listâ€ are also more likely to criminalize. These findings have broad implications for international governance and the exercise of soft power in the global information age.},

From the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Index to the Financial Action Task Force blacklist, global performance indicators (GPIs) are increasingly deployed to influence governance globally. We argue that GPIs derive influence from their ability to frame issues, extend the authority of the creator, and â€” most importantly â€” to invoke recurrent comparison that stimulates governments' concerns for their own and their country's reputation. Their public and ongoing ratings and rankings of states are particularly adept at capturing attention not only at elite policy levels but also among other domestic and transnational actors. GPIs thus raise new questions for research on politics and governance globally. What are the social and political effects of this form of information on discourse, policies and behavior? What types of actors can effectively wield GPIs and on what types of issues? In this symposium introduction, we define GPIs, describe their rise, and theorize and discuss these questions in light of the findings of the symposium contributions.},

Studies have consistently relied on settings, such as education, where quantitative data are easily accessible. Although these studies provide great insight, the findings may not translate into other policy settings. The concept of role perception allows expansion of representative bureaucracy studies into a variety of settings. Using Q-sort analysis, this project explores bureaucratic role perception, focusing on how bureaucrats see their role as representatives and on the effects of descriptive representation and organizational setting. Four perspectives on representative bureaucracy are identified: leaders, traditional bureaucrats, identity empathizers, and diversity advocates. These perspectives reflect Pitkinâ€™s discussion of representation and provide a more nuanced view of how bureaucrats see their roles. The findings suggest that (1) substantive representation may not require descriptive representation, (2) characteristics other than race and gender may be important, and (3) organizational variables may be related to bureaucratsâ€™ role perceptions. These findings illuminate future theoretical and empirical research possibilities},

This article examines how such asymmetries manifest in global governance for health, and how this impacts health outcomes. We focus on the political-economic determinants of global health inequities, and how these determinants operate at different levels of social action (micro, meso, and macro) through distinct but interacting mechanisms. To clarify how these mechanisms operate, we develop an integrative framework for examining the links between global neoliberalismâ€”the currently dominant policy paradigm premised on advancing the reach of markets and promoting ever-growing international economic integrationâ€”and global health inequities, and show how these mechanisms have macroâ€“macro, macroâ€“mesoâ€“macro, and macroâ€“microâ€“macro manifestations. Our approach enables the design of theoretically-nuanced empirical strategies to document the multiple ways in which the political economy entrenches or, alternatively, might ameliorate global health inequities.},

This provides a richer picture of when and why the U.S. exerts influence in multilateral settings and an alternate explanation to persistent questions about the role of international organizations in the international political economy.},

This paper first provides a brief overview of the IEGâ€™s rating process and the classifications used by the World Bank that may help scholars interested in evaluation, but unfamiliar with World Bank terminology, to use and interpret the database. Second, this paper examines whether geopolitical or institutional factors influence project performance assessments. We focus on how IEG selects projects for performance assessments and what factors influence project ratings in those assessments. We find some evidence that bureaucratic factors influence selection but only one geopolitical variableâ€”UNSC non-permanent membershipâ€”influences IEG ratings.},

Our results spanning 88 countries over 1960â€“2005 show that a positive long-run relationship between trade openness and financial development coexists with a negative short-run relationship. But when splitting the data into different income or inflation groups, this finding is observed only in relatively low-income countries or high-inflation economies.},

  abstract = {The Group of Seven (G7) Finance Ministers forum and now Group of Eight (G8) Summit was created as a high capacity institution to deliberate, take decisions, deliver them, and develop global governance in response to the cascading financial and other crisis starting in the 1970â€™s. It was also created to diffuse globally its core principles of â€œopen democracy, individual liberty and social advancement.â€ The changes brought by globalization, notably a succession of financial crises since 1994 and the terrorist shocks since September 11, 2001, have catalyzed the development since 1999 of a broader, more collectively capable Group of Twenty (G20) to help provide global governance in finance and related fields. The G20â€™s expanded number and range of systemically important countries as members increases the capacity, representativeness and resulting legitimacy of this new centre of collective leadership. But with non-democratic China and Saudi Arabia as members, and stability, growth and equity as core principles, to what extent can the G20 help globally diffuse the democratic norms its G8 members share? An analysis of the G20â€™s performance since its 1999 start suggests that the G20 has done much to adopt and diffuse democratic norms. The vulnerability and shocks bred by globalization shared by both members substantially helps explains this trend, as does the deepening institutionalization of the G20 as a balanced, autonomous, valued forum led by experienced hosts during the more shock free years since 2001. The strong G20 performance in democracy diffusion as well as in its deliberative, decisional and development of global governance functions sustains the case for elevating the G20 to a leaders level L20, for doing this deliberately rather than waiting for a new galvanizing shock, and for using the well performing G20 itself, rather than existing G8 or UN Summits as the institutional nest to give the L20 its birth.},

This study extends this work by adjusting the recommendations, making concrete proposals for two gender-related indicators, and presenting illustrative results for these proposed measures. These new measures include the calculation of a male and female Human Development Index (HDI), as well as a gender gap measure (GGM) to replace the GDI as a measure of gender inequality. The study also proposes and implements several modifications and simplifications to the GEM. With these adjustments, a number of Sub-Saharan countries now rank much higher, countries in the Middle East have lower scores in both measures, and some European countries fare notably worse in the revised GEM.},

This paper provides an overview of the USDG and explores some of the difficulties around using this goal as a tool for improving cities. We argue that challenges emerge around selecting the indicators in the first place and also around the practical use of these indicators once selected. Three main practical problems of indicator use include 1) the poor availability of standardized, open and comparable data 2) the lack of strong data collection institutions at the city scale to support monitoring for the USDG and 3) â€œlocalizationâ€ - the uptake and context specific application of the goal by diverse actors in widely different cities. Adding to the complexity, the USDG conversation is taking place at the same time as the proliferation of a bewildering array of indicator systems at different scales. Prompted by technological change, debates on the â€œdata revolutionâ€ and â€œsmart cityâ€ also have direct bearing on the USDG. We argue that despite these many complexities and challenges, the USDG framework has the potential to encourage and guide needed reforms in our cities but only if anchored in local institutions and initiatives informed by open, inclusive and contextually sensitive data collection and monitoring.},

Yet in some cases, the policy interventions adopted by the managers of these NGAs appear not to be welcomed by their supposed beneficiaries. This article accounts for this predicament by examining the effects of different configurations of accountability within NGAs promoting labor rights. Most labor-rights NGAs incorporate â€œproxy accountabilityâ€ arrangements, in which consumers and activists hold decision makers accountable â€œon behalfâ€ of the putative beneficiaries of the NGAs: workers and affected communities in poorer countries. The article shows how and why different combinations of proxy versus beneficiary accountability influence the choice of policy instruments used by NGAs, and applies the argument to three prominent non-state initiatives in the domain of labor standards.},

Finally, we present a design implication for the generation of visualization titles and one for the viewing of titles.},

The first is the continuing legacy of colonial constructions and the persistence of forms of racial difference and hierarchy in development. The second concerns the power of whiteness and specifically how authority, expertise and knowledge become racially symbolized. The third area for further examination is how â€˜raceâ€™ is disguised through the use of specialized terminology and criteria in accounting for poverty and social exclusion. The paper concludes by suggesting that debates around multiculturalism and anti-racism could inform a shift away from racialized representations and inequalities prevailing in development.},

The present study focuses on a panel of 27 transition and 20 developed countries between 1990 and 2006 and uses the latest developments in panel unit root and cointegration techniques to disentangle the effects of international spillovers via inflows of trade and FDI on total factor productivity (TFP). The findings show that imports remain the main channel of diffusion for both sets of countries, while FDI, although statistically significant, has a lower impact on productivity of the recipients. The domestic R\&D capital stock plays an active role in Western Europe while in the Eastern part it is less significant owing to lower levels, transitional disinvestment and relative obsolescence. Human capital affects TFP directly as a factor of production as well as indirectly by enhancing a country's absorptive capacity. In aggregate, the results show that transition countries from Eastern Europe and Central Asia seem to enjoy bigger productivity gains from the international diffusion process than their Western counterparts.},

However, factor market distortions in the transition economy create a comparative disadvantage in industry. Opening up to trade results in the import of indivisibles and a fall in manufacturing wages, breaking this virtuous circle. Consequently, trade liberalization without structural reform can have serious adverse effects in a transition economy.},

The "new trade theory"â€”an unfortunate phrase, now quite often referred to as "the old new trade theory"â€”also helped build a bridge between the analysis of trade between countries and the location of production within countries. In this paper I will try to retrace the steps and, perhaps even more important, the state of mind that made this intellectual transformation possible.

This book employs a gender-sensitive governmentality analysis to trace the emergence of the GRT, to map its conceptual and institutional elements, and to examine its broader implications. Through an analysis of the GRT at the international level, combined with an in-depth case study on Mexico, this book demonstrates that the GRT is instrumental in spreading and deepening specific forms of gendered neoliberal governmentality.

While world-system scholars argue that international trade increases when a hegemonic nation-state is powerful enough to provide geopolitical stability and trade-conducive policies, world-polity theorists maintain that trade results from the emanation of â€œcultural scriptsâ€ that create compatible national institutions and trust among nation-states. This article tests these theories by analyzing a global-level data set with information from 1945 to 2005 via autoregressive integrated moving-average models. The results provide strong support for the world-system contention that increases in the power of the hegemonic nation-state amplify levels of trade globalization. Furthermore, although there is some support for the world-polity contention that the spread of democracy is positively associated with international trade, there is little evidence to validate the claim that the proliferation of intergovernmental organizations enhances trade globalization.},

  abstract = {With COVID-19 and its economic fallout now spreading in the poorest parts of the world, many more people will become poor and food-insecure. In a new scenario analysis, we estimate that globally, absent interventions, 148 million people could fall into extreme poverty (measured against the PPP\$1.90 poverty line) in 2020â€”an increase of 20\% from present levels. This in turn would drive up food insecurity. A global health crisis could thus cause a major food crisisâ€”unless steps are taken to provide unprecedented economic emergency relief. Assessing the poverty impact of COVID-19 is not trivial, however. This is so not only because the crisis is still unfolding and available information of the precise socio-economic consequences is incomplete, but also because the channels of influence are multiple and interconnected globally. Furthermore, while a number of other analyses of the poverty impacts have assumed uniform shifts in the distribution of in-come per country, we are concerned that this assumption fails to take into account the complexity of the channels of effect. For these reasons, we use a global modelling framework to assess the potential impacts of the COVID-19 crisis on global poverty and food security. Specifically, we combine two economic modeling frameworks: the MIRAGRODEP global computable general equilibrium (CGE) model and the POVANA household dataset and model. The two frameworks are linked in top-down fashion; that is, results of the CGE model-based scenario analysis are introduced as inputs in the household survey data and model to assess poverty outcomes.},

Although no major food shortages have emerged as yet, agricultural and food markets are facing disruptions because of labor shortages created by restrictions on movements of people and shifts in food demand resulting from closures of restaurants and schools as well as from income losses. Export restrictions imposed by some countries have disrupted trade flows for staple foods such as wheat and rice. The pandemic is affecting all four pillars of food security (1): availability (is the supply of food adequate?), access (can people obtain the food they need?), utilization (do people have enough intake of nutrients?), and stability (can people access food at all times?). COVID-19 is most directly and severely impacting access to food, even though impacts are also felt through disruptions to availability; shifts in consumer demand toward cheaper, less nutritious foods; and food price instability. We outline the main threats COVID-19 poses to food security and suggest critical responses that policy-makers should consider to prevent this global health crisis from becoming a global food crisis.},

  abstract = {With COVID-19 and its economic fallout now spreading in the poorest parts of the world, many more people will become poor and food-insecure. In a new scenario analysis, we estimate that globally, absent interventions, 148 million people could fall into extreme poverty (measured against the PPP\$1.90 poverty line) in 2020â€”an increase of 20\% from present levels. This in turn would drive up food insecurity. A global health crisis could thus cause a major food crisisâ€”unless steps are taken to provide unprecedented economic emergency relief. Assessing the poverty impact of COVID-19 is not trivial, however. This is so not only because the crisis is still unfolding and available information of the precise socio-economic consequences is incomplete, but also because the channels of influence are multiple and interconnected globally. Furthermore, while a number of other analyses of the poverty impacts have assumed uniform shifts in the distribution of in-come per country, we are concerned that this assumption fails to take into account the complexity of the channels of effect. For these reasons, we use a global modelling framework to assess the potential impacts of the COVID-19 crisis on global poverty and food security. Specifically, we combine two economic modeling frameworks: the MIRAGRODEP global computable general equilibrium (CGE) model and the POVANA household dataset and model. The two frameworks are linked in top-down fashion; that is, results of the CGE model-based scenario analysis are introduced as inputs in the household survey data and model to assess poverty outcomes.},

Four approaches to the definition and measurement of poverty are reviewed in this paper: the monetary, capability, social exclusion and participatory approaches. The theoretical underpinnings of the various measures and problems of operationalizing them are pointed out. It is argued that each is a construction of reality, involving numerous judgements, which are often not transparent. The different methods have different implications for policy, and also, to the extent that they point to different people as being poor, for targeting. Empirical work in Peru and India shows that there is significant lack of overlap between the methods with, for example, nearly half the population identified as in poverty according to monetary poverty but not in capability poverty, and conversely. This confirms similar findings elsewhere. Hence, the definition of poverty does matter for poverty eradication strategies.},

The model builds on Fajgelbaum and Redding (2018) adding restrictions on internal mobility. We use this framework to identify which places are likely to gain and which places are likely to lose. The findings are that BRI transport investments favor development in larger urban districts near trade hubs, while people in more distant regions tend to lose out. Investments in trade facilitation are complementary policies that bring large additional welfare gains and can help in spatially spreading the benefits. However, barriers to internal labor mobility are likely to exacerbate wage inequalities while dampening overall welfare.},

Robust monitoring and evaluation (M\&E) ensures that the prospective benefits of interventions are being realized and it helps to improve the design of future projects and programmes. This paper is the first empirical assessment of M\&E frameworks used by development cooperation agencies for projects and programmes with adaptation-specific or adaptation-related components. It analyses documents for 106 projects across 6 bilateral development agencies. The analysis finds that Result Based Management, the Logical Framework Approach and the accompanying logframe are the most common M\&E approaches used for adaptation. In applying these approaches, the long-term perspective of most adaptation initiatives means that it is particularly important to clearly differentiate between outcomes, outputs and activities. In addition, M\&E frameworks for adaptation should combine qualitative, quantitative and binary indicators. Baselines for these indicators should be specified to improve understanding of progress. Significant challenges remain in relation to dealing with shifting baselines, attribution and time lags between interventions and outcomes.},

Data are systematically collected from National Communications prepared by Parties to the Convention and submitted periodically to the Secretariat. 4,104 discrete adaptation initiatives are identified and analyzed. Our findings indicate that while progress is being made on conducting impact and vulnerability assessments and adaptation research in nearly every country in the sample, translation of this knowledge into tangible adaptation initiatives is still limited. The largest number of reported adaptations falls under the category of infrastructure, technology, and innovation. Some types of vulnerability were more frequently reported across initiatives, including floods, drought, food and water safety and security, rainfall, infectious disease, and terrestrial ecosystem health. Notably, reporting on the inclusion of vulnerable sub-populations is low across all actions. Diffusion of adaptation across sectors remains underdeveloped, with the environment, water, and agricultural sectors emerging as the most active adaptors. Our analysis indicates that national communications provide a valuable source of information for global-scale adaptation tracking, but important gaps exist in the consistency of reporting that should be addressed, as these documents could greatly enhance efforts to monitor and evaluate adaptation progress.},

However, our previous work has not taken different types of aid and different types of decentralization into account, which is at the heart of our current analysis. We consider different measures of decentralization, in particular measures of fiscal decentralization derived from government finance statistics and measures of political decentralization that are constructed based on countriesâ€™ constitutional rules. In addition, we take different types of aid into account: grants, loans, technical assistance, total net ODA; and we distinguish between multi-lateral and bi-lateral aid in order to consider differences in the donor structure. Our empirical analysis is based on panel data of up to 53 developing countries. In our growth regressions, we combine all types of decentralization with the different types of aid. We find important differences between different types of decentralization: (i) fiscal decentralization negatively affects aid effectiveness (in line with our previous work), (ii) employment decentralization may increase aid effectiveness, and (iii) political decentralization does not hamper aid effectiveness or may even have positive effects.},

The tragic death toll and high rates of morbidity across many countries are an unprecedented setback and a calamity for those affected physically and mentally. The economic and social effects of lockdowns, loss of production and business confidence, and global recession will cast a long shadow over education systems. Despite the 435 million items that Google already indexes under â€œCOVID-19 educationâ€, many things remain unknown. No one has a clear idea of how the current pandemic will unravel over anything but the short term. The challenge is to strengthen the mechanisms to separate evidence from opinion and to balance popularism with speaking truth to powerâ€”especially when political systems can find it difficult to distinguish fact from convenient fiction.},

The lack of defined information management roles (including the people to fill them) inhibits collection and use of a range of different data types, including needs assessments, 3/4W, impact data, and monitoring data. Effective data sharing is undermined by limited and inconsistent data sharing practises. How best to treat sensitive data was found to be another challenge that all stakeholders needed to overcome when collecting, analysing and using data. Finally, data collection methodologies were found to often be unclear, or without rigour, suggesting that minimum quality control standards for data collection would be of value.},

The â€˜ICT for developmentâ€™ paradigm, which is seen as the conceptual linchpin of these cooperative activities, is considered to be a new version of the modernization paradigm. It is argued that, in many ways, UNESCOâ€™s partnerships with ICT corporations and its ethical approach of the information society/knowledge societies, turn a blind eye to structural political, economic and political economic inequalities. This ignorance is then related to UNESCOâ€™s turbulent history regarding the questioning of inequities in communication, media and information.},

This article attempts to provide some clues for a better understanding of this issue by examining China's views on and policy toward international multilateralism in general and some of the newly emerging multilateral mechanisms in particular, including the Group of 20 and the BRICS. The article concludes that while China will become more proactive in its multilateral diplomacy, in many cases selectively, and increase its influence in global multilateral settings, various concerns and constraints will make it unlikely for China to completely overhaul or even dramatically reshape the multilateral architecture at the global level. China is likely to repeat its pattern of the past decade in East Asian regional multilateralism: participation, engagement, pushing for cooperation in areas that would serve Chinese interests, avoiding excessive responsibilities, blocking initiatives that would harm its interests, and refraining from making grand proposals. In addition, China is stuck in defining its identity, and caught up between posturing as a leader of the developing world on some issues and siding with the developed countries on other policy issues. Given all of these constraints, China's involvement in global multilateralism is likely to be guided by pragmatism rather than grand visions. The article also argues that China will most likely strive to rise from within the existing international order. Washington should be prepared to plan its China policy on this basis and Sino-US relations will be shaped largely by the dynamics of contentions for power and interest as well as cooperation and coordination between China and the United States in various multilateral institutions.},

According to the numbers, we have been capable of building enough housing to compensate for the quantitative deficit; t he biggest challenge we face today is to how to make qualitative changes to the existing housing stock. Population growth continues to be strong in the emerging economies of the Global South, and exploring the potential of housing to transform the urban fabric is critical to building better cities.},

We argue in this article that attempts to quantify gender (in)equality globally have limited potential for successfully challenging gender hierarchies if compared to internationally agreed upon women's rights standards. To make this argument, we start by contrasting the general assumptions underlying the measurement approach with feminist scholarship on gender equality. Second, we examine nine key measures of global gender equality-the majority of which are produced by influential international organizations-and show that their focus on 'countability' perpetuates a narrow and misleading understanding of gender (in)equality. Third, we present the CEDAW Convention and associated review process as an alternative to the measurement approach. The comparison highlights the need for evaluative tools that attend to the complexity and fluidity of gender norms and focus on context-specific agency to confront gender hierarchies.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h2{$>$}Summary{$<$}/h2{$><$}h3{$>$}Background{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Achieving universal health coverage (UHC) involves all people receiving the health services they need, of high quality, without experiencing financial hardship. Making progress towards UHC is a policy priority for both countries and global institutions, as highlighted by the agenda of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and WHO's Thirteenth General Programme of Work (GPW13). Measuring effective coverage at the health-system level is important for understanding whether health services are aligned with countries' health profiles and are of sufficient quality to produce health gains for populations of all ages.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Methods{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Based on the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019, we assessed UHC effective coverage for 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2019. Drawing from a measurement framework developed through WHO's GPW13 consultation, we mapped 23 effective coverage indicators to a matrix representing health service types (eg, promotion, prevention, and treatment) and five population-age groups spanning from reproductive and newborn to older adults (â‰¥65 years). Effective coverage indicators were based on intervention coverage or outcome-based measures such as mortality-to-incidence ratios to approximate access to quality care; outcome-based measures were transformed to values on a scale of 0â€“100 based on the 2Â·5th and 97Â·5th percentile of location-year values. We constructed the UHC effective coverage index by weighting each effective coverage indicator relative to its associated potential health gains, as measured by disability-adjusted life-years for each location-year and population-age group. For three tests of validity (content, known-groups, and convergent), UHC effective coverage index performance was generally better than that of other UHC service coverage indices from WHO (ie, the current metric for SDG indicator 3.8.1 on UHC service coverage), the World Bank, and GBD 2017. We quantified frontiers of UHC effective coverage performance on the basis of pooled health spending per capita, representing UHC effective coverage index levels achieved in 2019 relative to country-level government health spending, prepaid private expenditures, and development assistance for health. To assess current trajectories towards the GPW13 UHC billion targetâ€”1 billion more people benefiting from UHC by 2023â€”we estimated additional population equivalents with UHC effective coverage from 2018 to 2023.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Findings{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Globally, performance on the UHC effective coverage index improved from 45Â·8 (95\% uncertainty interval 44Â·2â€“47Â·5) in 1990 to 60Â·3 (58Â·7â€“61Â·9) in 2019, yet country-level UHC effective coverage in 2019 still spanned from 95 or higher in Japan and Iceland to lower than 25 in Somalia and the Central African Republic. Since 2010, sub-Saharan Africa showed accelerated gains on the UHC effective coverage index (at an average increase of 2Â·6\% [1Â·9â€“3Â·3] per year up to 2019); by contrast, most other GBD super-regions had slowed rates of progress in 2010â€“2019 relative to 1990â€“2010. Many countries showed lagging performance on effective coverage indicators for non-communicable diseases relative to those for communicable diseases and maternal and child health, despite non-communicable diseases accounting for a greater proportion of potential health gains in 2019, suggesting that many health systems are not keeping pace with the rising non-communicable disease burden and associated population health needs. In 2019, the UHC effective coverage index was associated with pooled health spending per capita (\emph{r}=0Â·79), although countries across the development spectrum had much lower UHC effective coverage than is potentially achievable relative to their health spending. Under maximum efficiency of translating health spending into UHC effective coverage performance, countries would need to reach \$1398 pooled health spending per capita (US\$ adjusted for purchasing power parity) in order to achieve 80 on the UHC effective coverage index. From 2018 to 2023, an estimated 388Â·9 million (358Â·6â€“421Â·3) more population equivalents would have UHC effective coverage, falling well short of the GPW13 target of 1 billion more people benefiting from UHC during this time. Current projections point to an estimated 3Â·1 billion (3Â·0â€“3Â·2) population equivalents still lacking UHC effective coverage in 2023, with nearly a third (968Â·1 million [903Â·5â€“1040Â·3]) residing in south Asia.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Interpretation{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}The present study demonstrates the utility of measuring effective coverage and its role in supporting improved health outcomes for all peopleâ€”the ultimate goal of UHC and its achievement. Global ambitions to accelerate progress on UHC service coverage are increasingly unlikely unless concerted action on non-communicable diseases occurs and countries can better translate health spending into improved performance. Focusing on effective coverage and accounting for the world's evolving health needs lays the groundwork for better understanding how closeâ€”or how farâ€”all populations are in benefiting from UHC.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Funding{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Bill \& Melinda Gates Foundation.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

We find data quality issues least severe for two out of the five conventional economic indicators but extremely severe for the other three economic indicators, moderately severe for the one employment indicator, and extremely severe for the six environmental indicators except for energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. We also assess the feasibility of meeting conventional economic, employment, and energy targets by the year 2030 and find that they are overly optimistic for most countries. We propose setting additional and more realistic targets based on past country performance.},

Can humanitarian assistance reduce violence after civilians have been harmed? Crossnational studies are pessimistic, drawing a connection between humanitarian aid and increased civil war violence, lethality, and duration. To date, however, we have few subnational studies of wartime aid and subsequent violence. To examine this relationship, I draw on the Afghan Civilian Assistance Program (ACAP II), a USAID-funded initiative that investigated 1,061 civilian casualty incidents (2011â€“13). Aid was assigned as if randomly to about half (55.8\%) of these incidents, facilitating counterfactual estimation of how assistance affected Taliban attacks against the International Security Assistance Force, Afghan forces, and civilians. Challenging prior studies, I find that ACAP was associated with an average 23 percent reduction in attacks against ISAF, but not Afghan forces or civilians, at the village level for up to two years after the initial incident.},

Research on the influence of these variables on health outcomes in general, and cognitive test performance specifically, is presented. This research indicates that when variables such as quality of education, wealth, and perceived racism are taken into account, the effect of race/ethnicity on health outcomes is greatly reduced. In other words, race/ethnicity serves as a proxy for these more meaningful variables, and explicit measurement of these constructs will improve research of health within majority and minority ethnic groups.},

More recently, a number of studies have used structured observations to study practices related to diarrhoea. During a trial of a hygiene education intervention to reduce diarrhoea among young children in Bandundu, Zaire, both instruments were used to measure the disposal of child faeces and various hand-washing practices. Three hundred families were observed and follow-up interviews performed with 274 (91\%) mothers. At the individual level, agreement between observed and reported behaviour was little better than might be expected by chance. There was evidence of over-reporting of hand-washing before food preparation (44\%vs 33\%; P= 0.03), hand-washing before eating (76\%vs 60\%; P {$<$} 0.001) and disposal of the childâ€™s faeces in a latrine (75\%vs 40\%; P {$<$} 0.001). On the other hand, hand-washing before feeding the child was reported less often than it was observed (7\%vs 64\%; P {$<$} 0.001). Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that, in general, mothers over-report â€˜desirableâ€™ behaviours. At the same time, our data indicate that open questions may lead to under-reporting of certain behaviours. The repeatability of observations at both the individual and population levels remains to be established.},

Yet the historical record amply demonstrates how international efforts to control infectious disease, beginning in the mid-nineteenth century and extending to the present, have dominated global health policies, regulations, agendas and budgets: often at the expense of addressing more chronic health and environmental concerns. How these challenges have affected present circumstances and created demands for an entirely new conception and execution of 21st century global health efforts is the focus of this paper.},

The Logistics Performance Index (LPI) analyses differences between countries in terms of customs procedures, logistics costs and the quality of the infrastructure for overland and maritime transport. The aim of this article is to analyse the impact that each of these components has on trade in emerging economies using a gravity model. Furthermore, the study also attempts to detect possible advances in logistics in developing countries, which are grouped into five regions (Africa, South America, Far East, Middle East and Eastern Europe) by comparing the first LPI data published in 2007 with the most recent data, released in 2012. The results obtained reveal that improvements in any of the components of the LPI can lead to significant growth in a countryâ€™s trade flows. Specifically, LPI components are becoming increasingly important for international trade in many countries in Africa, South America and Eastern Europe.},

This paper shows that, if the violation of labor standards results from discrimination against particular workers in export industries, employment, output, and competitiveness will be reduced since employment is determined by the short side of the market. If the problems arise from abuse of market power by employers, competitiveness will be similarly reduced. Only if freedom of association and collective bargaining were intended to allow workers in some sectors to restrict output and drive up wages would the absence of these standards raise competitiveness. However, if product markets are competitive, it is likely that association rights would increase output and competitiveness by raising productivity. The competitiveness argument seems either to reflect analytical confusion or to represent a cover for protectionist interests.},

  abstract = {A detailed examination of the GATT regime for international trade, discussing the negotiating record, policy background, economic rationale, and case law. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) was created alongside other towering achievements of the post-World War II era, including the United Nations, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund. GATT, the first successful agreement to generate multilateral trade liberalization, became the principal institution to administer international trade for the next six decades. In this book, Petros Mavoidis offers detailed examination of the GATT regime for international trade, discussing the negotiating record, policy background, economic rationale, and case law. Mavroidis offers a substantive first chapter that provides a detailed historical background to GATT that stretches from the 1927 World Economic Conference through Bretton Woods and the Atlantic Charter. Each of the following chapters examines the disciplines agreed to, their negotiating record, their economic rationale, and subsequent practice. Mavroidis focuses on cases that have influenced the prevailing understanding of the norm, as well as on literature that has contributed to its interpretation, and the final outcome. In particular, he examines quantitative restrictions and tariffs; the most favored nation clause (MFN), the cornerstone of the GATT edifice; preferential trade agreements and special treatment for products originating in developing countries; domestic instruments; and exceptions to the obligations assumed under GATT. This book's companion volume examines World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements regulating trade in goods.},

  abstract = {Renewed emphasis on programs and policies aimed at enhancing food security has intensified the search for accurate, rapid, and consistent indicators. Measures of food security are urgently required for purposes of early warning, assessment of current and prospective status of at-risk populations, and monitoring and evaluation of specific programs and policies. Different measures are often used interchangeably, without a good idea of which dimensions of food security are captured by which measures, resulting in potentially significant misclassification of food insecure populations. The objective of this paper is to compare how the most frequently used indicators of food security portray static and dynamic food security among the same sample of rural households in two districts of Tigray State, Northern Ethiopia. Seven food security indicators were assessed: the Coping Strategies Index (CSI); the Reduced Coping Strategies Index (rCSI); the Household Food Insecurity and Access Scale (HFIAS); the Household Hunger Scale (HHS); Food Consumption Score (FCS); the Household Dietary Diversity Scale (HDDS); and a self-assessed measure of food security (SAFS). These indicators provide very different estimates of the prevalence of food insecurity, but are moderately well correlated and depict generally similar food security trends over time. We suggest that the differences in prevalence estimates, and in some cases the weaker than expected correlation, can be explained in three ways. First, the indicators differ in the underlying aspect of food security they attempt to capture. Second, each indicator is likely only sensitive within a certain severity range of food insecurity and these ranges do not always overlap. Third, categorization of the prevalence of food insecurity is strongly dependent on the choice of cut-off points. For valid reasons, â€œfood insecurityâ€ has no accepted gold standard metric against which individual indicators can be gauged, though without one it is difficult to say which indicator performs â€œbestâ€ in correctly and reliably identifying food insecure households. The implication is that using more than one indicator is advisable, and policy makers should be aware of what elements of food insecurity each indicator portrays.},

Yet despite concerted efforts from national governments, multilateral organisations and NGOs over many decades we are still far from achieving education for all. In addition, while education can enhance human development, it is also associated with persistent inequalities. Education and International Development provides a comprehensive introduction to the field, giving an overview of the history, influential theories, important concepts and areas of achievement, and presenting a critical reflection on emerging trends in policy, practice and research. With chapters that review key challenges and inspiring initiatives in countries around the globe - focusing on critical issues such as language, conflict and teachers - this book serves both as a companion to graduate studies in international education and a concise reference book for practitioners and educators in the field.},

  abstract = {The economic empowerment of women is emerging as a core focus of both economic development and gender equality programmes internationally. At the same time, there is increasing importance placed on measuring outcomes and quantifying progress towards gender and development goals. These trends raise significant questions around how well gender differences are understood, especially in economies dominated by the informal sector and characterised by a highly gendered division of labour, as is the case in many Pacific countries. How well do existing international and national indicators of gender equality reflect the experiences and aspirations of Pacific women and men? What do concepts such as gender equality and economic empowerment mean in this geographical context? How might local attitudes and practices be identified and measured? In this paper, we draw on Boaventura De Sousa Santosâ€™ call to recognise and value knowledges of the majority world that have been rendered either largely invisible or non-credible by mainstream development and human rights policy agendas. Reflecting on an action research project conducted with partner organisations in Fiji and the Solomon islands, we explore a more nuanced place-based approach to understanding and measuring gender equality and economic empowerment. This approach takes account of diverse economic practices, such as non-market transactions, and forms of non-cash exchange and unpaid labour, and recognises the imbalance in womenâ€™s and menâ€™s household and care work.},

  abstract = {Growing awareness of the size and organizational potential of informal economies in the era of globalization has triggered a profusion of research on linkages between the formal and informal economies, moving in a range of empirical and theoretical directions. This Working Paper reviews over 200 items of current literature on formal-informal linkages under four categories â€“ linkage mapping, institutional design, governance effects, and the politics of formal-informal linkages. These four categories explore distinctive approaches to linkages as mechanisms for mapping, tapping, vesting or contesting the distribution of resources, power and legitimacy between the formal and informal economies. With a focus on developing countries, this Working Paper considers how the realities of globalization, market reforms, and the crisis of the global (formal) economy have reshaped the geographical, sectoral and regulatory scope of formal-informal linkages. It addresses a new, more complex problematic that focuses not only on patterns of linkages and whether they are beneficial or not, but also for whom, and with what impact on the governance structures of formal as well as informal economies. As the review shows, formal-informal linkages can improve but also worsen the distribution of costs and benefits, and so are not necessarily conducive to empowerment. The integration of informal workers and enterprises into global value chains, and the rise of complex multi-stakeholder networks have created new possibilities for inclusion of informal actors in wider structures of economic growth and decision making. But these linkages have also generated processes of outsourcing and labour informalization that have proven more exploitative than empowering. Innovative processes of co-production and political inclusion, while able to enhance informal political voice, can also turn formal-informal linkages into techniques of governance and subordination. Understanding the specific distributional effects and power relations within these networks is crucial to understanding their ultimate impact on informal economy actors. After examining what the existing literature reveals, and identifying research gaps, the author outlines policy implications and a framework for further research. Policy implications focus on the distinctive needs of entrepreneurial and survivalist informal actors; policies to encourage synergistic rather than exploitative linkages; the management of multi-stakeholder networks; and policy diagnostics for assessing the developmental impact of co-production and hybrid governance arrangements.},

  abstract = {During the current seventh cholera pandemic, Africa bore the major brunt of global disease burden. More than 40 years after its resurgence in Africa in 1970, cholera remains a grave public health problem, characterized by large disease burden, frequent outbreaks, persistent endemicity, and high CFRs, particularly in the region of the central African Great Lakes which might act as reservoirs for cholera. There, cases occur year round with a rise in incidence during the rainy season. Elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa, cholera occurs mostly in outbreaks of varying size with a constant threat of widespread epidemics. Between 1970 and 2011, African countries reported 3,221,050 suspected cholera cases to the World Health Organization, representing 46 \% of all cases reported globally. Excluding the Haitian epidemic, sub-Saharan Africa accounted for 86 \% of reported cases and 99 \% of deaths worldwide in 2011. The number of cholera cases is possibly much higher than what is reported to the WHO due to the variation in modalities, completeness, and case definition of national cholera data. One source on country specific incidence rates for Africa, adjusting for underreporting, estimates 1,341,080 cases and 160,930 deaths (52.6 \% of 2,548,227 estimated cases and 79.6 \% of 209,216 estimated deaths worldwide). Another estimates 1,411,453 cases and 53,632 deaths per year, respectively (50 \% of 2,836,669 estimated cases and 58.6 \% of 91,490 estimated deaths worldwide). Within Africa, half of all cases between 1970 and 2011 were notified from only seven countries: Angola, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mozambique, Nigeria, Somalia, Tanzania, and South Africa. In contrast to a global trend of decreasing case fatality ratios (CFRs), CFRs have remained stable in Africa at approximately 2 \%. Early propagation of cholera outbreaks depends largely on the extent of individual bacterial shedding, host and organism characteristics, the likelihood of people coming into contact with an infectious dose of Vibrio cholerae and on the virulence of the implicated strain. Cholera transmission can then be amplified by several factors including contamination of human water- or food sources; climate and extreme weather events; political and economic crises; high population density combined with poor quality informal housing and poor hygiene practices; spread beyond a local community through human travel and animals, e.g., water birds. At an individual level, cholera risk may increase with decreasing immunity and hypochlorhydria, such as that induced by Helicobacter pylori infection, which is endemic in much of Africa, and may increase individual susceptibility and cholera incidence. Since contaminated water is the main vehicle for the spread of cholera, the obvious long-term solution to eradicate the disease is the provision of safe water to all African populations. This requires considerable human and financial resources and time. In the short and medium term, vaccination may help to prevent and control the spread of cholera outbreaks. Regardless of the intervention, further understanding of cholera biology and epidemiology is essential to identify populations and areas at increased risk and thus ensure the most efficient use of scarce resources for the prevention and control of cholera.},

There are indicators of rule of law, indicators of violence against women, and indicators of economic development, among many others. Indicators are widely used at the national level and are increasingly important in global governance. There are increasing demands for â€œevidence-basedâ€ funding for nongovernmental organizations and for the results of civil society organizations to be quantifiable and measurable. The reliance on simplified numerical representations of complex phenomena began in strategies of national governance and economic analysis and has recently migrated to the regulation of nongovernmental organizations and human rights. The turn to indicators in the field of global governance introduces a new form of knowledge production with implications for relations of power between rich and poor nations and between governments and civil society. The deployment of statistical measures tends to replace political debate with technical expertise. The growing reliance on indicators provides an example of the dissemination of the corporate form of thinking and governance into broader social spheres.},

We rely on indicators to translate social phenomena into simple, quantified terms, which in turn can be used to guide individuals, organizations, and governments in establishing policy. Yet counting things requires finding a way to make them comparable. And in the process of translating the confusion of social life into neat categories, we inevitably strip it of context and meaningâ€”and risk hiding or distorting as much as we reveal.  With The Seductions of Quantification, leading legal anthropologist Sally Engle Merry investigates the techniques by which information is gathered and analyzed in the production of global indicators on human rights, gender violence, and sex trafficking. Although such numbers convey an aura of objective truth and scientific validity, Merry argues persuasively that measurement systems constitute a form of power by incorporating theories about social change in their design but rarely explicitly acknowledging them. For instance, the US State Departmentâ€™s Trafficking in Persons Report, which ranks countries in terms of their compliance with antitrafficking activities, assumes that prosecuting traffickers as criminals is an effective corrective strategyâ€”overlooking cultures where women and children are frequently sold by their own families. As Merry shows, indicators are indeed seductive in their promise of providing concrete knowledge about how the world works, but they are implemented most successfully when paired with context-rich qualitative accounts grounded in local knowledge.},

It assesses the dramatic changes in the political, economic, and business background from the early 2000s (shaping the MDGs) to the early 2010s (designing the SDGs). These changes rarely get the attention they merit, despite their profound consequences on how to useâ€”or not useâ€”trade policies for promoting development. Following this, it examines the three major phases in the MDG/SDG progress: first, a pro-trade agenda during the preparation of the MDG Report (2002â€“2005) insisting on the positive impact of trade for development ifâ€”a big ifâ€”economically sound trade policies are adopted; then, uninspiring MDG8 Gap Reports cantoned in the increasingly sterileâ€”and economically unsoundâ€”World Trade Organization negotiations during the implementation period of the MDGs (2007â€“2015); finally, the ignorance of the trade potential for a â€œbetter lifeâ€ during the preparation of the SDGs (2013â€“2015). The paper also provides a telling comparison of the MDGsâ€™ and SDGsâ€™ very different inputs and outputs. The paper concludes by stressing the largely ignored common regulatory agenda between trade policies and the SDGs, arguing that a well-designed trade policy could play a key role for improving domestic regulations, and, hence, contribute to the SDGsâ€™ ultimate goalâ€”a â€œbetter lifeâ€.},

We analyse the significance of these developments for the governance of refugee populations and make the case that within the current policy context of European border control, data functions to systematically stigmatize, exclude and oppress â€˜unwantedâ€™ migrant populations through mechanisms of criminalisation, identification, and social sorting. This, we argue, highlights the need to engage with data politics in a way that considers both the politics in data as well as the politics of data, highlighting the agendas and interests that advance the implementation of these technologies, privileging justice concerns on terms that go beyond techno-legal solutions, and positioning those who are most impacted by developments at the forefront of discussions.},

In 2017, in low-income and middle-income countries spending on HIV/AIDS was \$20Â·2 billion (17Â·0â€“25Â·0) and on tuberculosis it was \$10Â·9 billion (10Â·3â€“11Â·8), and in malaria-endemic countries spending on malaria was \$5Â·1 billion (4Â·9â€“5Â·4).

In 2019, \$374 million of DAH was provided for pandemic preparedness, less than 1\% of DAH. Although spending has increased across HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria since 2015, spending has not increased in all countries, and outcomes in terms of prevalence, incidence, and per-capita spending have been mixed. The proportion of health spending from pooled sources is expected to increase from 81Â·6\% (81Â·6â€“81Â·7) in 2015 to 83Â·1\% (82Â·8â€“83Â·3) in 2030.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Interpretation{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Health spending on SDG3 priority areas has increased, but not in all countries, and progress towards meeting the SDG3 targets has been mixed and has varied by country and by target.

  abstract = {The Paris Agreement has been celebrated as a breakthrough for international climate policy. However, relatively scant attention has been given to the emergent ecosystem of climate finance facilities that support it. We provide an overview of the rising number of climate-related trust funds at multilateral development banks (MDBs). These funds can be distinguished into mitigation funds and adaptation funds. Some funds have a focus on capacity building activities. To maximize their effect on sustainable development, the different types of funds should follow different resource allocation criteria: For adaptation funds, vulnerability should represent the primary criterion. For mitigation funds, the main criterion should be the emission reduction potential. Capacity building should primarily focus on countries with weak institutions. Using a novel dataset of disbursements of climate-related trust funds, available for the World Bank, we examine whether fund allocations correspond to these expectations, and compare them with those of bilateral donors. We find that while trust funds with a focus on mitigation generally allocate aid in line with efficiency considerations, trust funds with a focus on adaptation do not seem to prioritize the countries most strongly in need, contrary to bilateral aid. Furthermore, capacity building activities do not seem to focus on countries with weak institutions. These findings have important implications for the effectiveness and legitimacy of climate aid to developing countries.},

Debate continues on what domains constitute womenâ€™s empowerment and how to measure empowerment across countries. Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) are the most widely available source of data on womenâ€™s empowerment. However, measurement invariance often is assumed, but not tested. We used DHS data from Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda to test factor structure and measurement invariance of womenâ€™s empowerment among married women ages 15â€“49. Factor analysis confirmed a three-latent-domain model of womenâ€™s empowerment in each country capturing womenâ€™s human/social assets, gender attitudes related to wife abuse, and womenâ€™s participation in household decisions. Multi-country confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) identified an invariant three-factor model of womenâ€™s empowerment and a subset of country-specific items. Our results offer a standardized, invariant measure of womenâ€™s empowerment that can be applied to monitor womenâ€™s empowerment cross-nationally in East Africa, and possibly beyond.},

  abstract = {In Mexico, the measurement of maternal death has demonstrated the extent to which the risk to women's lives is determined by their class, location, and ethnicity. In this paper, I examine how the Mexican federal government has implemented measurement and monitoring regimes to track and respond to maternal deaths. Drawing on field research and interviews conducted at various times between 2004 and 2010, I consider some of the contradictory knowledge and governance effects that this turn to measurement has generated in the Mexican health-care system. Measurement and monitoring regimes, I argue, have given maternal health advocates the evidence to argue that it is failings within the health-care system which have made high levels of mortality so intractable. At the same time, measuring mortality has rendered broader aspects of sexual and reproductive rights less visible, while also generating a politics of responsibility and culpability. I trace in this paper a tendency by some health-care professionals to resist what they see as the punitive nature of maternal health monitoring regimes, by either â€˜gamingâ€™ the numbers, and/or shifting responsibility other, usually more vulnerable, populations. This analysis highlights the importance of attending to the context in which measurement regimes are introduced. In the context of a deeply flawed system, measurement regimes will generate tensions around responsibility which cannot easily be resolved, and may be resisted by those on whom the regime depends for its reliability.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Why do countries sometimes use multilateral strategies and institutions for pursuing their foreign policies? Since World War Two the advanced industrial countries â€“ basically, the OECD countries â€“ have chosen to distribute part of their foreign aid through multilateral organizations, such as the European Union (EU), World Bank, IMF, UN, and regional development banks (RDBs). In particular I want to understand why these countries have chosen to delegate varying amounts of aid to these international organizations over the past 40 years. The delegation of aid-giving to multilateral organizations is surprising; it reduces a country's control over its own foreign policy and has the potential to increase principal-agent problems associated with all spending programs. The other choice that these countries had was to use their own bilateral aid agencies to select projects and oversee aid expenditures, which was the traditional practice prior to the 1960s. So the question addressed is why delegate the provision of foreign aid to a multilateral organization instead of using traditional bilateral channels. The total amount of such multilateral aid is not inconsequential. For instance, the World Bank gives aid in two main forms. The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) uses its donor subscription base as collateral to borrow money on world capital markets, which it then lends at below market interest rates to developing countries. In 2001 the IBRD committed roughly \$10.5 billion in low interest loans (World Bank 2001a).},

It applies panel data model to examine the effects of composite infrastructure index and its individual components on human development and its three dimensions. The study establishes close linkage between infrastructure and human development. Telecommunication, postal services, village electricity, banking, school, PTR and drinking water facilities play significant roles in the process of attaining high level of human development. The less developed districts of Odisha are primarily dominated by tribal population. In order to achieve high and sustained human development, the state needs to prioritize its efforts towards infrastructure creation for these regions.},

I argue that conditional aid is effective but its efficacy depends on recipient countriesâ€™ level of democracy because the value of aid to governments depends on the degree to which it helps them maintain power, and recent work shows that the marginal impact of aid on political survival increases with level of democracy. I test this argument on data from 68 countries over the period from 1980 to 1999. I focus on the impact of IMF and World Bank aid on fiscal reform, one of the most commonly stipulated conditions in aid-for-policy arrangements. I find that aid from the Bretton Woods institutions promotes fiscal reform, but only in more democratic countries. KeywordsAid conditionality-Democracy-Policy reform},

Based on the definition, we provide five expressive forms as a framework for judging city sustainability, using a concept of two types of indicators: constraint and maximisation indicators. Constraint indicators judge sustainability of cities based on relevant criteria in terms of environmental sustainability and socio-economic distributional justice. Maximisation indicators measure the benefits cities produce in economic and social aspects. Indicators in the three dimensions â€“ environmental, economic and social indicators â€“ can be categorised into the two types of indicators. In conclusion, we need to assess the two dimensions of cities â€“ limitations and benefits â€“ independently without offsetting one against the other in terms of strong sustainability.},

In this article, we analyze the economic and disaster data from 1970 through 2010 to investigate the impact of disasters on country/region-level economic growth. We leveraged a random parameter modeling approach to develop the growth-econometrics model that identifies risk factors significantly influencing~the country/region-level economic growth in the face of natural hazard-induced disasters, while controlling for country/region- and time-specific unobserved heterogeneities. We found that disaster intensity in terms of fatalities and homelessness, and economic characteristics such as~openness to trade and a governmentâ€™s consumption share of purchasing power parity~(PPP), are the significant risk factors that randomly vary for different countries/regions. Other significant factors found to be significant include population, real gross domestic product~(GDP), and investment share~of PPP converted GDP per capita. We also found that flood is the most devastating disaster to affect country/region-level economic growth. This growth-econometrics model will help in the policy and decision making of governments related to the investment needs for pre- and post-disaster risk mitigation and response planning~strategies, to better protect nations and minimize disaster-induced economic impacts.},

Through the 1980s and 1990s, donor countries and institutions trended to make aid conditional upon reforms in the recipient country, which was found largely ineffective in encouraging real policy changes. More recently, donors, such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the United States, are increasingly insisting upon performance and good governance as a prerequisite for aid, a practice called â€œselectivity.â€ This is a means of requiring a recipient state to demonstrate the seriousness of its commitment to economic and social reforms. There are no objective standards for determining good governance: some aspects include political stability, the rule of law, control of corruption, and accountability. High levels of poverty and weak governance are linked, making selectivity difficult to implement. For reforms to succeed, domestic support, ownership, and commitment are crucial, as are the recipient's cultural context and history.},

The transparency and disclosure policies of the World Bank and regional development banks are found to vary in important details. Their policies have advanced the status of transparency in development discourse and practice, and contributed to redefining the relationships among MDBs, states and citizens. At the same time they set limits that constrain information disclosure's significance in practice.},

More specifically, it considers whether IFIs are powerful â€œglobalizersâ€ of the developing world or ineffective organizations whose grand plans are forever thwarted by savvy governments promising sweeping reforms that never materialize. Drawing on the findings from thirty-one recent empirical studies, it concludes that there is no clear evidence that the IFIsâ€™ conditional lending has significant effects on structural reforms in developing countries. Nevertheless, the chapter argues that we should not regard the IFIs as completely useless agents in the effort to remake developing countriesâ€™ economies over the past thirty years, suggesting that their indirect effects on liberalizing policy reforms may be more important than the direct effects.},

Nelson suggests, and its professional staff emerged from an insular set of American-trained economists. The IMF treats countries differently depending on whether that staff trusts the country's top officials; that trust in turn depends on the educational credentials of the policy team that Fund officials face across the negotiating table. Intellectual differences thus lead to lasting economic effects for the citizens of countries seeking IMF support.Based on deep archival research in IMF archives and personnel files, Nelson argues that the IMF has been the Johnny Appleseed of neoliberalism: neoliberal policymakers sprout and take root in countries that have spent recent decades living under the Fundâ€™s conditional lending arrangements. Nelson supports his argument through quantitative measures and illustrates the dynamics of relations between the Fund and client countries in a detailed examination of newly available archives of four periods in Argentinaâ€™s long and often bitter relations with the IMF. The Currency of Confidence ends with Nelsonâ€™s examination of how the IMF emerged from the global financial crisis as an unexpected victor.},

It is evident that the forces of globalization provide a strong potential for a major reduction in poverty in the developing world. However, for a number of reasons brought out in this chapter, the positive impact of globalization on poverty alleviation worldwide has not been as substantial as one might have expected. In this chapter we explore structural factors and policies within the world economy and national economies that impede the full transmission of the benefits of the various channels of globalization to poverty reduction.},

  abstract = {Defining poverty, how it could be measured and alleviated have always been contested issues. Over the decades, different authors have proposed different definitions and measurement methods that have been applauded for a while before being discarded as inadequate. This paper examines some definitions of poverty in detail and argues that the way poverty has been defined over the years has influenced the kind of poverty alleviation initiatives that have been designed and implemented. The paper further argues that these poverty alleviation initiatives have been temporal and unsustainable because they have been trying to solve a wrongly defined concept. The prevalent definitions of poverty would best be described as fruits of poverty, rather than poverty itself. This paper will, therefore, examine these definitions of poverty and how these definitions have ill-informed the current ineffective and unsustainable poverty eradication strategies. It will then put forward a new definition of poverty that came out of a qualitative, rights-based approach to participative action research, which was a part of a Ph.D. field study, conducted in rural Malawi and its implications.},

  abstract = {Scholars and practitioners have been working on methodologies to measure water security at a variety of scale and focus. In this paper, we critically examine the landscape of water security metrics, discussing the progress and gaps of this rich scholarship. We reviewed a total of 107 publications consisting of 17 conceptual papers and 90 methodological papers that propose 80 metrics to measure water security and observed that there are two dominant research clusters in this field: experiential scale-based metrics and resource-based metrics. The former mainly focus on measuring the water experiences of households and its impact on human well-being, while the majority of the latter assess freshwater availability or water resources security. We compare their approaches and the arguments used to develop them. We posit that the more local the scale and the more specific the water domain, the more meaningful results that the metrics can provide. Acknowledging the interrelationship between different water domains (e.g., water resources and water hazards) is important, but their aggregation for measurement may be problematic. We offer our views on future work in this field relating to topics beyond water, the need to conduct validation tests, and collaboration among academics and with other stakeholders.

The analysis is based on the views of 133 respondents â€“ 88 developing countries, 35 donors, 5 providers of South-South trade-related support and 5 regional organisations â€“ who participated in the 2019 aid-for-trade monitoring and evaluation exercise. They share the view that economic diversification is a gateway for economic empowerment, but also that empowerment is essential for economic diversification particularly when it enables youth, women and micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises to engage in international trade.},

I will try to explain why economists for free trade start to defend some protectionist steps for some industries and why some countries protect their important industries to gain more, although they are members of GATT and WTO. There are a lot of theoretical and empirical studies on the possibility that strategic trade policies can enable firms to increase their share of rents from oligopolistic international markets. The theoretical strategic trade literature makes clear that this is a controversial result. Despite these concerns, the empirical literature continues to grow. In the same time, the attempts to liberalize the trade between nations are still growing. General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and its successor, the World Trade Organization (WTO) is one of the most cited examples of a successful international institution to liberalize international trade. But even if the WTO annual reports and website are analyzed, someone easily understand that GATT and WTO still have problems on applying free trade and telling itself to countries and individual whether GATT and WTO are for free trade or not. There are ten misunderstanding on the WTO website about WTO, most important of them is â€œcommercial interest takes priority over development, WTO ignores development and WTO acts blindly for free tradeâ€.},

This paper argues that such rapid reductions will become increasingly hard to achieve for two reasons. First, the majority of the poor now live in middle-income countries where the benefits of growth have often been distributed selectively and unequally. Second, a reservoir of extreme poverty remains in low-income countries where growth is erratic and aid often fails to reach the poor. If the international community is to most effectively leverage available resources to end extreme poverty, it must ensure that its investments in institutions and physical infrastructure actually provide the poor the capabilities they need to craft an effective pathway out of poverty. We term the human and social systems that are required to form this pathway â€œinvisible infrastructureâ€ and argue that an effective domestic state is central to building this. By corollary, ending extreme poverty will require both expanding state capacity and giving the poor power to demand reforms they need by solving agency problems between citizens, politicians, and bureaucrats.},

However, little research has been done to examine the effects of data visualization in influencing users or in making a message more persuasive. In this study, we present experimental research to fill this gap and present an evidence-based analysis of persuasive visualization. We built on persuasion research from psychology and user interfaces literature in order to explore the persuasive effects of visualization. In this experimental study we define the circumstances under which data visualization can make a message more persuasive, propose hypotheses, and perform quantitative and qualitative analyses on studies conducted to test these hypotheses. We compare visual treatments with data presented through barcharts and linecharts on the one hand, treatments with data presented through tables on the other, and then evaluate their persuasiveness. The findings represent a first step in exploring the effectiveness of persuasive visualization.},

  abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has brought data to the centre of policymaking and public attention. A diverse ecosystem of data producers, both private and public, report rates of infection, fatality and recovery on a daily basis. However, a proliferation of data, which is at times contradictory, can also lead to confusion and mistrust among data users. Meanwhile, policymakers, development partners and citizens need to take quick, informed actions to design interventions that reach the most vulnerable and leave no one behind. As countries comply with lockdowns and other containment measures, national statistical systems (NSSs) face a dual effect of growing data demand and constrained supply. This in turn may squeeze NSSs beyond their institutional capacity. At the same time, alternative data sources such as mobile phone or satellite data are in abundance. These data could potentially complement traditional sources such as censuses, surveys and administrative systems. However, with scant governance frameworks to scale and sustain their use, policy action is not yet based on a convergence of evidence. This policy brief introduces a conceptual framework that describes the adverse effects of the crisis on NSSs in developing countries. Moreover, it suggests short and medium-term actions to mitigate the negative effects by: 1. Focusing data production on priority economic, social and demographic data. 2. Communicating proactively with citizens, academia, private sector and policy makers. 3. Positioning the NSO as advisor and knowledge bank for national governments. NSSs contribute significantly to robust policy responses in a crisis. The brief thus calls on national statistical offices to assume a central role as coordinators of the NSSs and chart the way toward improved data ecosystem governance for informing policies during and after COVID-19.},

Moreover, the book warns that an obsession with measurement rather than process can undermine efforts to foster transformative and empowering outcomes.

  abstract = {Sustainable development has broad appeal and little specificity, but some combination of development and environment as well as equity is found in many attempts to describe it. However, proponents of sustainable development differ in their emphases on what is to be sustained, what is to be developed, how to link environment and development, and for how long a time. Despite the persistent definitional ambiguities associated with sustainable development, much work (over 500 efforts) has been devoted to developing quantitative indicators of sustainable development. The emphasis on sustainability indicators has multiple motivations that include decision making and management, advocacy, participation and consensus building, and research and analysis. We select a dozen prominent examples and use this review to highlight their similarities and differences in definition of sustainable development, motivation, process, and technical methods. We conclude that there are no indicator sets that are universally accepted, backed by compelling theory, rigorous data collection and analysis, and influential in policy. This is due to the ambiguity of sustainable development, the plurality of purpose in characterizing and measuring sustainable development, and the confusion of terminology, data, and methods of measurement. A major step in reducing such confusion would be the acceptance of distinctions in terminology, data, and methods. Toward this end, we propose an analytical framework that clearly distinguishes among goals, indicators, targets, trends, driving forces, and policy responses. We also highlight the need for continued research on scale, aggregation, critical limits, and thresholds.},

Given the central logic of race and racism in European colonialism, and the decolonial argument that colonialism continues in the production and value of knowledge, I examine the presence and absence of race and racism in discussions of decolonising higher education and in development studies. Through a systematic review and content analysis of papers published in six major development studies journals over the past 13 years, I identify where and how race is present in current development scholarship and explore the implications of this for a decolonial turn in development studies.},

Their concrete information needs is highly context-influenced and often they find themselves unable to access the right information at the right time.

First, we select a group of in-field decision makers and collect their concrete information needs in the disaster aftermath. We then review to what extent existing data and tools can already address these needs. We conclude that existing solutions fall short in meeting important information needs of the selected group. We describe the design of an information system prototype to address these gaps more accurately. We combine data of the International Aid Transparency Initiative and the Humanitarian Data Exchange to form the data-backend of our system. We describe our implementation approach and evaluation plan.},

We identify trade freedom, monetary freedom and freedom from corruption as the most important indicators of economic freedom for growth in transition countries over the period 1994â€“2007.

  abstract = {Times of economic uncertainty, civil unrest and disaster are linked to a myriad of risk factors for increased violence against women and children (VAW/C). Pandemics are no exception. In fact, the regional or global nature and associated fear and uncertainty associated with pandemics provide an enabling environment that may exacerbate or spark diverse forms of violence. Understanding mechanisms underlying these dynamics are important for crafting policy and program responses to mitigate adverse effects. Based on existing published and grey literature, we document nine main (direct and indirect) pathways linking pandemics and VAW/C, through effects of (on):(1) economic insecurity and poverty-related stress, (2) quarantines and social isolation, (3) disaster and conflict-related unrest and instability, (4) exposure to exploitative relationships due to changing demographics, (5) reduced health service availability and access to first responders, (6) inability of women to temporarily escape abusive partners, (7) virus-specific sources of violence, (8) exposure to violence and coercion in response efforts, and (9) violence perpetrated against health care workers. We also suggest additional pathways with limited or anecdotal evidence likely to effect smaller sub-groups. Based on these mechanisms, we suggest eight policy and program responses for action by governments, civil society, international and community-based organizations. Finally, as research linking pandemics directly to diverse forms of VAW/C is scarce, we lay out a research agenda comprising three main streams, to better (1) understand the magnitude of the problem, (2) elucidate mechanisms and linkages with other social and economic factors and (3) inform intervention and response options. We hope this paper can be used by researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to help inform further evidence generation and policy action while situating VAW/C within the broader need for intersectional gender- and feminist-informed pandemic response.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} In a globalised world, the transfer of carbon between regions, either physically or embodied in production, represents a substantial fraction of global carbon emissions. The resulting emission transfers are important for balancing regional carbon budgets and for understanding the drivers of emissions. In this paper we synthesise current understanding in two parts: (1) CO\textsubscript{2} emissions embodied in goods and services that are produced in one country but consumed in others, and (2) carbon physically present in fossil fuels, petroleum-derived products, harvested wood products, crops, and livestock products. We describe the key differences between studies and provide a consistent set of estimates using the same definitions, modelling framework, and consistent data. We find the largest trade flows of carbon in international trade in 2004 were fossil fuels (2673 MtC, 37 \% of global emissions), CO\textsubscript{2} embodied in traded goods and services (1661 MtC, 22 \% of global emissions), crops (522 MtC, 31 \% of total harvested crop carbon), petroleum-based products (183 MtC, 50 \% of their total production), harvested wood products (149 MtC, 40 \% of total roundwood extraction), and livestock products (28 MtC, 22 \% of total livestock carbon). We find that for embodied CO\textsubscript{2} emissions, estimates from independent studies are robust, and that differences between individual studies are not a reflection of the uncertainty in consumption-based estimates, but rather these differences result from the use of different production-based emissions input data and different definitions for allocating emissions to international trade. After adjusting for these issues, results across independent studies converge to give less uncertainty than previously assumed. For physical carbon flows there are relatively few studies to be synthesised, but differences between existing studies are due to the method of allocating to international trade, with some studies using "apparent consumption" as opposed to "final consumption". While results across studies are sufficiently robust to be used in further applications, more research is needed to understand differences and to harmonise definitions for particular applications.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

My focus is on the KOF indices of globalisation that have been used in more than 100 studies. Early studies using the KOF index reported correlations between globalisation and several outcome variables. Studies published more recently identify causal effects. The evidence shows that globalisation has spurred economic growth, promoted gender equality and improved human rights. Moreover, globalisation did not erode welfare state activities, did not have any significant effect on labour market interaction and hardly influenced market deregulation. It increased, however, within-country income inequality. The consequences of globalisation thus turn out to be overall much more favourable than often conjectured in the public discourse.},

  abstract = {China, in its quest for a closer strategic partnership with Africa, has increasingly dynamic economic, political and diplomatic activities on the continent. Chinese leaders and strategists believe that Chinaâ€™s historical experience and vision of economic development resonates powerfully with African counterparts and that the long standing history of friendly political linkages and development co-operation offers a durable foundation for future partnership. In doing so, we see from the Chinese side and amongst some western commentators a form of exceptionalism and generalisation regarding both China and Africa. In this paper instead we seek to develop theoretical tools for examining China as a geopolitical and geoeconomic actor that is both different and similar to other industrial powers intervening in Africa. This is premised on a political economy approach that ties together material interests with a deconstruction of the discursive or â€˜extra-economicâ€™ ways by which Chinese capitalism internationalises. From there we use this framework to analyse contemporary Chinese engagement in Africa. We examine the changing historical position of Africa within Beijingâ€™s foreign policy strategy and Chinaâ€™s vision of the evolving international political system, looking in particular at Chinaâ€™s bilateral and state-centric approach to working with African â€˜partnersâ€™. Chinese practice is uncomfortable and unfamiliar with the notion of â€˜developmentâ€™ as an independent policy field of the kind that emerged among Western nations in the course of the 1950s and increasingly China has come to be viewed as a â€˜rogue creditorâ€™ and a threat to the international aid industry. Rather than highlighting one strand of Chinese relations with African states (such as aid or governance) we propose here that it is necessary to critically reflect on the wider geopolitics of China-Africa relations (past and present) in order to understand how China is opening up new â€˜choicesâ€™ and altering the playing field for African development for the first time since the neo-liberal turn of the 1980s.},

  abstract = {In urban slums â€“ home to approximately 1 billion people worldwide - access to clean drinking water is woefully inadequate despite the United Nations' declaration that access to safe water is a fundamental human right. Households in slums are frequently forced to rely on multiple drinking water sources to meet their needs. Numerous factors influence choice of water source, including water quality, availability, reliability, and affordability. These factors are not temporally static, but instead vary over multiple timescales (from sub-daily changes to annual changes and beyond) in response to changes in the water source itself and changes in the household's ability to use that source. For example, the cost of water can may change over time in response to water availability (e.g. rainy season versus dry season) and a slum household's ability to pay for water may change over time in response to changes in household income. However, existing national and global monitoring of safe water access, including Sustainable Development Goal 6, overlook these temporal dynamics of water access, quality and health risk in slums. This paper proposes a research agenda for exploring temporal changes in drinking water access and quality in urban slums and their potential influence on health risk. It argues that in the design of research studies, policy interventions, and drinking water monitoring aimed at improving access and health in urban slums, temporal dynamics should be considered over at least three interlinked time scales: short-term (from sub-daily to week-to-week), medium-term (from month-to-month to season-to-season) and long-term (from year-to-year). The paper concludes with recommendations for future research on temporal dynamics of drinking water and health in slums.},

These calculations are based on the empirical relationship between grades completed and ability to read, a descriptive â€˜learning profile.â€™ The large literature on schooling and life outcomes suggests simple correlations are a reasonable guide to causal effects, and the typical concern is over-estimation of the true return to schooling â€“ implying our calculations using a descriptive and not causal learning profile are a best-case scenario. This best case is often not at all good: the learning profile is so weak in Nigeria that even if all women had completed grade six, adult female illiteracy would only have fallen from 58 percent to 53 percent. In contrast, children in many other countries do learn to read in much higher numbers and enrolling out-of-school girls would dramatically reduce illiteracy. For instance, in Ethiopia the same calculations yield a reduction in illiteracy from 82 to 25 percent. But across nearly fifty developing countries with available data our calculations suggest 40 percent of women would be illiterate even if all women completed at least grade six. Achieving new Sustainable Development Goal targets of universal literacy and numeracy will require both achievement of universal schooling and dramatic improvements in the learning profile in most developing countries.},

In addition, it depicts the cyclical patterns of political activity dealing with sustainability and identifies the main sustainability goals and targets endorsed by several political initiatives. These tasks are accomplished through a literature review and an assessment of indicators dealing with political will. It is concluded that global sustainability governance followed an intermittent path characterized by two periods of significant accomplishments (until 1979; 1987â€“1995) and by two others less successful (1980â€“1986; 1995 onwards, interrupted by a peak around 2000). Peaks in political activity coincide with the decennial Earth Summits, suggesting their major influence as catalysts of more profound societal and political action. Sustainability concerns and goals shifted from an emphasis on pollution control and availability of natural resources to a more balanced position that puts human development at the center.

These applications entail Big Data for Development in which social problems, poverty, food security and responses to climate disasters can be solved in the most efficient and effective manner. This brave new world of solving pressing problems through machine learning has several dark sides. A data divide is being created that leaves the most vulnerable populations out of the solutions being created while discriminating against those whose data is churned by obscure algorithms. Complex mathematical models together with computing algorithms produce scores that are used to evaluate the lives of the masses. These systems have scaled to enormous proportions, changing lives by affecting credit scores, job prospects and access to healthcare. The promise of fairness, transparency, cost-effectiveness and efficiency gives rise to powerful scoring algorithms that have the power to create mass devastation while discriminating against the most vulnerable. Questions arise as to: What injustices (types of injustice) are created by datafication of development? how can the injustices caused by the extraction, analysis and commoditization of data be alleviated? Who has access to and what is being done with private data? And for whose benefit or purpose is personal data being extracted? Such questions are explored through the contributions in on data justice, the use of ICTs by micro-Entrepreneurs, mobile money and financial inclusion offered through papers in this issue.},

  abstract = {Attention of international trade and macroeconomic experts has focused on the effect of international trade, precisely trade openness, on economic growth and by extension on unemployment rate, albeit with mixed results. However, scanty attention has been drawn towards the effect of current account balance on unemployment rate despite the arguments from different quarters trailing such relationship. By employing Autoregressive Distribution Lag estimation technique, this study specifically focuses on the short-run dynamic and long-run effects of trade openness and current account balance on unemployment rate in Nigeria using the data that span 1981-2014. We found that trade openness worsens unemployment rate both in the short-run and long run. We also discovered that in the short run, current account balance increases unemployment rate but reduces it in the long run. Control variables used in the study such as inflation rate, exchange rate, and FDI followed a priori expectation while real GDP, wages and government consumption expenditure failed to follow a priori expectation. We, therefore, concluded that there is need for sound trade and macroeconomic policies to aid domestic firmsâ€™ production to ensure international competitiveness of these firms so as to guarantee employment generation.},

  abstract = {Stories on the positive and negative effects of globalization on workers in developing countries abound. But a comprehensive picture is missing and many of the stories are ideologically charged. This paper reviews the academic literature on the subject, including several studies currently under way, and derives the implications for public policy. First, it deals with the effects of openness to trade, foreign direct investment, and financial crises on average wages. Second, it discusses the impact of exposure to world markets on the dispersion of wages by occupation, skill, and gender. Third, it describes the pattern of job destruction and job creation associated with globalization. Because these two processes are not synchronized, the fourth issue addressed is the impact on unemployment rates. Fifth, the paper reviews the labor market policies that can be used to offset the adverse effects of globalization on employment and labor earnings. Finally, it discusses how the international community could encourage developing countries to adopt sound labor market policies in the context of globalization.},

In line with current efforts to â€˜decolonise development studiesâ€™, we critically reflect on the underlying assumptions of this line of thinking. We establish a framework that differentiates between potential positive and negative fungibility. We hypothesise that recipient governments can redirect their own funds and achieve positive fungibility, if (1) the marginal value added in the alternative target sector/region is higher; (2) equity concerns are adequately addressed when other sectors/regions are supported; and (3) temporal delay helps to cushion instability of aid flows. There are indications that this positive fungibility might be quite prevalent. Future fungibility research should therefore no longer assume that fungibility is in itself undesirable.},

  abstract = {We systematically reviewed current climate change literature in order to examine how multiple processes that affect human vulnerability have been studied. Of the 125 reviewed articles, 79 \% were published after 2009. There are numerous concepts that point out to stressors other than climate change that were used in reviewed studies. These different concepts were used interchangeably, and they illustrate processes that act on different scales. Most widely used concepts included non-climatic (40 \% of the articles), multiple stressors (38 \%) and other factors (37 \%). About 75 \% of the studies either acknowledged or carefully analyzed the social and environmental context in which vulnerability is experienced. One-third of the studies recognized climate change-related stressors as the most important, one-third argued that stressors other than climate are more important, and the rest of the studies did not analyze the relative importance of the different processes. Interactions between different stressors were mentioned in 76 \% and analyzed explicitly in 28 \% of the articles. Our review shows that there are studies that analyze the social context of vulnerability within climate change-related literature and this literature is rapidly expanding. Reviewed studies point out that there are multiple interacting stressors, whose interlinkages need to be carefully analyzed and targeted by policies, which integrate adaptation to climate change and other stressors. In conclusion, we suggest that future studies should include analytical frameworks that reflect dissimilarities between different types of stressors, methodological triangulation to identify key stressors and analysis of interactions between multiple stressors across different scales.},

  abstract = {This paper provides a review of the literature on the development impact of migration and remittances on origin countries and on destination countries in the South. International migration is an ever-growing phenomenon that has important development implications for both sending and receiving countries. For a sending country, migration and the resulting remittances lead to increased incomes and poverty reduction, and improved health and educational outcomes, and promote economic development. Yet these gains might come at substantial social costs to the migrants and their families. Since many developing countries are also large recipients of international migrants, they face challenges of integration of immigrants, job competition between migrant and native workers, and fiscal costs associated with provision of social services to the migrants. This paper also summarizes incipient discussions on the impacts of migration on climate change, democratic values, demographics, national identity, and security. In conclusion, the paper highlights a few policy recommendations calling for better integration of migration in development policies in the South and the North, improving data collection on migration and remittance flows, leveraging remittances for improving access to finance of recipient households and countries, improving recruitment mechanisms, and facilitating international labor mobility through safe and legal channels.},

A welfarist interpretation of global poverty lines is augmented by the idea of normative functionings, the cost of which varies across countries. In this light, current absolute measures are seen to ignore important social effects on welfare, while popular, strongly relative measures ignore absolute levels of living. It is argued that a new hybrid measure is called for, combining absolute and weakly relative measures consistent with how national lines vary across countries. Illustrative calculations indicate that we are seeing a falling incidence of poverty globally over the past 30 years. This is mainly due to lower absolute poverty counts in the developing world. While fewer people are poor by the global absolute standard, more are poor by the country-specific relative standard. The vast bulk of poverty, both absolute and relative, is now found in the developing world.},

  abstract = {This paper rejects the characterization of globalization as an autonomous and irresistible process driven by the impersonal forces of the market and technical progress. Whether domestic or global, market forces are shaped and controlled by policy choices and the institutional frameworks in which they are made. In the absence of adequate institutional frameworks and productive capacities, rapid liberalization is as likely to lead to stagnation and unemployment as to growth and rising incomes per head. We show that the major economic forces presumed to be crucial for spreading the benefits of globalization have been less global than often presented, have proved to be much weaker than widely predicted and carry potentially damaging effects as well as benefits. Accordingly, and without denying that by the late 1970s many developing countries needed to find new ways of inserting themselves into the international economy, we argue that the new policy orientation of macroeconomic stringency, downsizing the public sector and the rapid opening of developing country markets to foreign trade and capital after the debt crisis, has failed to produce an economic environment that supports faster economic growth and strengthens productivity performance. In suggesting the outlines of a more strategic approach to economic development the emphasis is on the need for domestic investment to be mobilized as the basis for industrialization and for a gradual approach to integration with the global economy.},

This paper contributes to this line of inquiry by assessing gender differences in morbidity across five major US racial and ethnic populations. Using data from the 1997â€“2001 waves of the National Health Interview Survey, the analysis examines differences in men and women's self-rated health, functional limitations, and life-threatening medical conditions for whites, blacks, Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, and Cubans. For each health outcome, we investigate the utility of socioeconomic factors in accounting for observed disparities. Contrary to finding universal excess in female morbidity, the results show that the magnitude of gender difference varies considerably by racial/ethnic group, health outcome, and comparison category. The most striking findings are the consistently higher levels of functional limitations for all women compared to men in their same racial/ethnic group and the poorer health of black women relative to both white and black men for all health measures, after adjustment for socioeconomic and background factors. The gender gap for all other health measures is more variable, and for Mexican women a difference is only evident for functional limitations and only when compared to Mexican men. Our results underscore the need for more research on the role of race and ethnicity in shaping gendered health inequalities and the mechanisms that lead to such variable patterns of difference across and within US racial and ethnic populations.},

It argues that the superficial consensus that has characterized much of the early debate has given way to a series of parallel but distinct discourses around sustainability. The underlying assumptions behind much of the discussion are assessed, as is the move, after the first Earth Summit (1992), to focus on rights, rather than needs, as the principal line of enquiry. This analytical attention to rights is linked to the neo-liberal economic agendas of the 1990s, and the growth of interest in congruent areas, including human security and the environment, social capital, critical natural capital and intellectual property rights. The paper argues that increasing attention to questions of biology and science studies has strengthened this â€˜rights-basedâ€™ approach, as well as interest in the linkages between â€˜naturalâ€™ and â€˜humanâ€™ systems, including attention to questions of environmental justice. It is clear that issues of global environmental justice are as important as they were when the concept of â€˜sustainable developmentâ€™ was in its infancy, but the new material realities of science and the environment in the 21st century demand a re-engagement with their social consequences, something which is largely ignored by the (market) liberal consensus.

As health providers, we are often taught that â€˜taking a historyâ€™ is a critical component of a patient consultation to ensure that the underlying conditions are treated rather than the often superficial presenting symptoms. In the same way, attempts to make sense of the health and well-being of Indigenous peoples is inadequate unless health providers engage critically with the history of their respective nations and any subsequent patterns of privilege or disadvantage. Understanding this history, within the framework of western imperialism and other similar colonial projects, allows us to make sense of international patterns of Indigenous health status. While health commentators acknowledge the unequal health outcomes of Indigenous people, and an increasing number also link these inequities to Indigenous marginalisation resulting from historic events, very few go further and expose the deep relationship between racism and coloniality and how these continue to be the basic determinants of Indigenous health today. This work includes honest examination of the role that science and the health disciplines have played historically in colonisation through the subjugation of Indigenous ways of knowing and knowledge production, as well as being complicit in the creation and maintenance of a fabricated hierarchy of humankind. Despite the â€˜scienceâ€™ of this racial hierarchy being discredited, it retains a false validity in our societies. As long as oppressive systems that continue to re-inscribe racism and white privilege remain in communities, including our academic communities, coloniality continues its discrimination.

  abstract = {Over the past two decades, earmarked funding to international development organizations through special-purpose trust funds has increased greatly. This paper studies the incentives for trust funds from the perspective of multilateral agencies, notably the World Bank. A theoretically intriguing type of funds are so-called â€œpass-on funds,â€ in which one unit hosts the fund, then passes on its resources to another type of unit for implementation. Each unit has different preferences for the specific types of activities to be supported by the fund. Interviews with World Bank staff and complementary documents demonstrate the rationale for pass-on funds and the associated division of labor between fundraising network units and implementing regional units. While pass-on funds reflect an efficient division of labor between functionally specialized units, they increase the misalignment between sector-specific global priorities and country-specific needs. Organizational reform drove the sudden explosion of pass-on funds around the millennium turn, facilitated by growing availability of donor monies for specific sectors and by lenient internal regulation. Organizational reform undermined budget autonomy of sector units, causing those units to seek new funds in their areas of expertise. A number of reform features also reduced administrative budgets of country units, increasing their demand for pass-on funding grants. The results contribute to the emerging literature on earmarked funding and highlight the need to consider international organizations as heterogeneous actors.},

  abstract = {Trust funds â€“ broadly defined as financial vehicles to channel development funding earmarked for specific purposes through international development organizations â€“ have grown substantially over the past two decades. Reflecting the variety of trust fund purposes and related governance arrangements, an emergent literature emphasizes a diversity of reasons underlying this growth. This paper proposes a simple â€“ yet encompassing â€“ explanation applicable to all kinds of funds: donors use trust funds to wield â€˜influenceâ€™ â€“ leveraging financial resources to alter the policies of multilateral organizations. Based on interviews at the World Bank, the study shows that influence is a dominant motive behind trust funds, though the capacity and willingness to wield influence varies across donors. Influence is a salient motive especially for medium-sized donors and emerging donors but surprisingly less so for large donors. In addition, attempts of influence are most effective when donors promote new thematic issues that did not previously feature Bank assistance and outside established programs. Concerns among stakeholders about undue donor influence are highest with respect to the global knowledge work of the World Bank but are virtually absent when involving donors in the operational activities at the country level.},

This paper focuses on the fact that the IMF may favour geopolitically important countries in the distribution of IMF loans, differentiating between concessional and non-concessional facilities. To carry out the empirical analysis, we construct a new database that compiles a wide array of proxies for geopolitical importance for 107 IMF countries over 1990â€“2003, focusing on emerging and developing economies. We use a factor analysis to capture the common underlying characteristic of countries' geopolitical importance as well as a potential analysis since we also want to account for the geographical situation of the loan recipients. While controlling for economic and political determinants, our results show that geopolitical factors influence notably lending decisions when loans are non-concessional, whereas results are less robust and in opposite direction for concessional loans. This study provides empirical support to the view that geopolitical considerations are an important factor in shaping IMF lending decisions, potentially affecting the institution's effectiveness and credibility.},

Poor measurement hampers current research efforts, and improving empowerment measurement is a frequently identified research priority. However, a discussion of specific steps researchers can take to improve upon common measurement practices is lacking. The purpose of this paper is to provide quantitative researchers recommendations to measure womenâ€™s empowerment in a theory-based, precise, and comprehensive way. This paper reviewed key theoretical concepts of womenâ€™s empowerment and critically reviewed common measurement approaches. Three broad recommendations for measuring empowerment emerged from this critical review, and specific suggestions to meet these recommendations are discussed. First, researchers should draw upon theory to construct measurement models (e.g., using theory to construct dimensions of empowerment and selection of indicators). Second, researchers should use analytic methods that minimize implicit judgments and bias (e.g., not classifying women as empowered using specific criteria). Third, researchers should collect comprehensive empowerment information (e.g., supplementing quantitative measures with qualitative interviews to learn how and why changes took place). Measuring empowerment poses a number of challenges, and this review provides researchers suggestions to improve upon common measurement practices. Improved measurement will strengthen research efforts on the causes and consequences of poor empowerment, which has the potential to improve the well-being of women and their children.},

We assess the extent of the multidimensionality of poverty using the original Alkireâ€“Foster measure of multidimensional poverty. We then make estimates of the global profile of multidimensional poverty in 2015 using the Alkireâ€“Foster measure and two alternative indices. We conclude that the worldâ€™s multidimensionally poor are largely young people, residing in rural areas though not necessarily working in agriculture. Overall, the contribution of the paper is to explain how multidimensional poverty indices differ; and to present a new set of estimates of the global multidimensional poverty profile for 2015.},

But there are other competing perspectives as well. One (trumpeted elsewhere in Washington) puts faith on extensive institutional reform, and another (exemplified by the U.N.

Sorting intelligently among these diverse perspectives requires an explicitly diagnostic approach that recognizes that the binding constraints on growth differ from setting to setting.},

Though the localisation agenda is at the core of current reform efforts in the humanitarian sector, the debate lacks a critical discussion of underlying assumptions â€“ most strikingly, the very conceptualisation of the local itself. It is argued that the current discourse is dominated by a problematic conceptualisation of the local in binary opposition to the international, leading to blind spots in the analysis of exclusionary practices of the humanitarian sector. As such the localisation agenda risks perpetuating the very issues it wants to redress. A critical localism is thus proposed as a framework for much needed research on the localisation agenda.},

  abstract = {In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, official development assistance (ODA) remains an essential, though often criticised, form of external financing for developing countries. At the same time, the pandemic risks aggravating existing pressures on ODA which may erode its credibility and the volume of public concessional, cross-border resources made available for development purposes. We revisit the evolution of ODA and discuss three such pressures: ODA/GNI ratio targets threaten ODA budgets when GNI is falling in many donor countries; flawed new rules on scoring debt relief as ODA will lead to large-scale doublecounting just as debt relief looks ever more likely; and the increasingly-blurred boundary between global public goods and traditional ODA may allow the former to displace the latter. We discuss ways in which the Development Assistance Committee has sought to mitigate these pressures in the past, and conclude that alternative strategies may be required. To this end, we recommend that the DAC rolls back its new debt relief rules, considers an additional target tier for â€œbeyond ODAâ€ spend on global public goods, and commits to greater transparency and developing country participation in its financial metric-setting processes.},

While services account for about 50\% of world trade in value added terms, services trade policies are often restrictive and multinational commitments are generally modest. Taking steps to raise the profile of services trade within government policy-making would help close this gap and highlight the contribution of services trade policy to a wide range of broader national objectives that have an important services dimension, whether small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) and gender policy, or the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).}{$<$}br{$><$}/p{$>$}},

Whereas the SDGs have a global dimension, their action implementation depends on the level of priority different countries give to them, and on how sustainability issues compete with a country's main problems. The aim of this paper was to identify the main Sustainable Development Goals approached by experts from different geographic regions, according to their experience and research area, and to discuss the relation between these goals and the main local issues and challenges of each region. The methodology starts with snowball sampling to collect information from experts from all geographic regions, through contact networks of universities in different countries. With the information about the goals researched by the participating experts, an analysis of the relation between the study focus and the geographical regions of origin was conducted. A total of 266 specialists from North America, Latin America/Caribbean, Africa, Asia, Europe and Oceania participated in the survey. Based on the sample used, it can be said that there is a relation between the local problems or challenges observed in some regions and the main areas of interest of the surveyed experts, with a general emphasis on the study of goals 4, 11 and 13. Based on the data gathered, the paper presents a set of examples of positive and negative situations in the various regions, and considers the extent to which some Sustainable Development Goals are being pursued by research on a worldwide basis.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: This descriptive finding examines excess deaths following Hurricane MarÃ­a, in Puerto Rico for September and October 2017. OBJECTIVE: We seek to determine the degree of excess deaths in Puerto Rico based on historical patterns of variability in deaths by month for the 2010-2016 period and using estimation techniques. METHODS:  Data for this study come from death records from the Puerto Rico Vital Statistics system. We aggregated data by month and year (2010-2016) and produced means (expected deaths) and 95\% confidence intervals (C.I., or patterns of variability) for each month. Using public statements from the Puerto Rico Department of Public Safety, we estimate the number of deaths for September and October 2017 and compare it to the level of expected deaths considering the pattern of variability. RESULTS: Expected deaths for September and October were 2,383 (95\% C.I. 2,296-2,469) and 2,428 (95\% C.I. 2,380 - 2,476), respectively. Estimates for total deaths, for September and October 2017 were 2,987 (95\% CI 2,900-3,074) and 3,043 (95\% C.I. 2,995-3,091), respectively. The difference between our estimates and the upper 95\% CI for the average deaths is 518 deaths for September and 567 deaths for October. CONCLUSIONS: The mortality burden may higher than official counts, and may exceed the current official death toll by a factor of 10 or more.},

It is usually suggested that FLFP rises whenever trade expands those sectors which use female labor intensively. This paper develops a theoretical model to argue that, quite surprisingly, the opposite effects can occur. Distinguishing between female intensive sectors (FIS) and male intensive sectors (MIS), we show that FLFP may actually fall if trade expands FIS. When FIS are capital intensive, trade integration of a capital-abundant economy expands FIS and contracts MIS. Consequently, male workers migrate from MIS to FIS, diluting the capitalâ€“labor ratio in the FIS. Under a high complementarity between capital and female labor, the marginal productivity of women drops more than that of men. Thus, the gender wage gap widens and FLFP falls.

Divergent national positions were to be expected based upon the different stages of economic development and according to previously existing international groups. The actual controversies in the G20 did not reflect these patterns, however, but showed divergence both between industrialised countries and between emerging economies. In explaining this puzzle, I argue that the driving forces for global economic governance have ceased to be industrialised or emerging countries' alliances and levels of development. Rather, the causes for the positions of G20 members can be found in economic interests and ideas dominant in the domestic politics of countries. These societal influences shape governmental preference formation in both industrialised and emerging countries and consequently influence their behaviour in global governance. The resulting divergences weaken previously existing groups such as the G7 and the BRICs, and create a new pattern in world politics. This societal approach to explaining governmental positions in global economic governance is exemplified on the core G20 issues of stimulus/public debt and global imbalances/exchange rates.},

Trade can contribute to meeting those goals, but only if the policies are adapted accordingly. Given that they largely build on existing international commitments, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are not demanding revolutionary change. But it is an important step forward that the Agenda lays out a comprehensive programme for all policy areas, indicating what would be required to achieve sustainability at all levels. Especially in developed countries, there is widespread criticism that trade policy and globalisation worsen inequalities within and between states, endanger ecological stability and social security, and perpetuate unsustainable patterns of consumption. Implementing the SDGs would also represent a constructive response to these justified criticisms of globalisation. (author's abstract)},

Hundreds of alternative measurement systems have been proposed to measure sustainable development. This paper argues for harmonization of these methods, and facilitates this discussion by providing a detailed comparison of countryâ€level measures. The analysis includes 55 systems (12 composite indicators and 43 sustainable development indicator (SDI) sets). The analysis shows that SDI sets are more common than composite indicators. This paper also shows that composite indicators generally focus on environmental themes, while SDI sets are broader in scope through inclusion of more social themes. Overall, we find a great degree of agreement on the most popular indicators and themes in SDI sets. However, we do find that certain indicators are more prevalent in higher and lower income countries. The article emphasizes the need for harmonization of measurement systems, but also shows the importance of flexibility at the country level.

It also reviews how the two indexes were used in academia and the press. The main result of the review is that the GDI in particular seems to be a measure that is not used appropriately. In most cases of misuse, the GDI was wrongly interpreted as a measure of gender inequality. Due to the many misinterpretations, the potential policy impact the GDI and GEM can have seems limited.},

  abstract = {The CSIS Economics Program is tracking commitments, approvals, and disbursements by major international financial institutions (IFIs) to meet the massive financing needs generated by the Covid-19 pandemic and its economic fallout. These IFIs include the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, and regional development banks. We also include select regional financing arrangements (RFAs), which, together with the IFIs, central bank bilateral swap lines, and individual countriesâ€™ foreign reserve holdings, comprise the Global Financial Safety Net (GFSN). Based on data as of July 14: We estimate IFIs have approved \$140.7 billion in Covid-19-related support since January 27, an increase of \$23.7 billion since our last data update on June 19. The IMF has approved \$82.8 billion, including emergency assistance and precautionary lines of credit, while the multilateral development banks (MDBs) combined have approved \$57.4 billion. Since our June update, the IMF approved three new programs totaling \$5.6 billion while MDBs approved \$18.0 billion in new funding.  We estimate IFIs have disbursed \$88.9 billion, about two-thirds of the amount approved. Reflecting the precautionary nature of a large portion of IMF support, the IMF has disbursed around 40 percent of its approved funding, or \$33 billion. MDBs have disbursed \$55.3 billion, or 96 percent of the total amount approved.  Regionally, the Americas have been the largest recipient of IFI approvals, while Asia/Oceania and Africa have received the most disbursements. IFIs have approved \$58.8 billion in funding for the Americas but have only disbursed \$12.9 billion, reflecting the three IMF precautionary Flexible Credit Lines with Colombia, Chile, and Peru. Asia/Oceania and Africa have received \$29.4 billion and \$27.8 billion in disbursements, respectively.  Amendments to the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization (CMIM) came into effect on June 23. Resources totaling about \$240 billion under the multilateral currency swap arrangement between the 10 Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member states, China, Japan, and South Korea have not yet been drawn; however, the recent amendments address issues around its use in relationship to IMF financing, suggesting the CMIM is in a better position to respond to membersâ€™ financing needs should they materialize.

Since the last update, we have added the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) to the dataset, and the Eurasian Fund for Stabilization and Development (EFSD) has approved and disbursed funding. At the beginning of the pandemic, the IsDB committed \$2.3 billion to support the crisis response of its member countries and has since approved and disbursed almost the entirety of this amount.

  abstract = {This commentary is an updated version of one originally published April 13, 2020. Confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) exceed 3 million as of April 30 and continue to climb. To combat the virusâ€™ spread, governments have implemented restrictions on economic activity unprecedented in peacetime. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development estimates that containment measures will cause an initial decline in the level of output of 20 to 25 percent in many economies, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects negative global growth for 2020 with â€œthe worst economic fallout since the Great Depression.â€ In response to this unprecedented shock, governments have pledged massive economic support, from direct payments to individuals to â€œlimitlessâ€ loans for struggling businesses. At a March 26 virtual summit, leaders of the Group of Twenty (G20) major economies said they were spending over \$5 trillion, equivalent to 7.4 percent of 2019 G20 countriesâ€™ gross domestic product (GDP), to â€œcounteract the social, economic, and financial impacts of the pandemic.â€ Since then, G20 governments have added to this figure as the extent of the economic fallout has become clearer. Developed by the CSIS iDeas Lab. Data updated through April 29, 2020 The CSIS Simon Chair analyzed and categorized major fiscal actions taken by G20 countries to respond to the economic shock. Several key trends emerge: Fiscal support has increased since April 10: As of April 29, we estimate that G20 countries are providing \$6.3 trillion in fiscal support, representing 9.3 percent of 2019 G20 GDP. Of the total, \$3.2 trillion will support direct government spending (4.8 percent of 2019 G20 GDP), up from \$2.1 trillion (3.1 percent of GDP) as of April 10. Credit enhancements contribute \$2.3 trillion and tax relief another \$0.8 trillion. G20 loan guarantee frameworks alone exceed \$2 trillion: G20 economies, led by European countries, have announced loan guarantee frameworks exceeding \$2 trillion, representing 3 percent of 2019 G20 GDP. Given that many guarantee frameworks do not quantify ex ante fiscal outlays, we assign a 50 percent â€œfiscal costâ€ to guarantee figures resulting in our headline fiscal support figure of \$6.3 trillion. Assigning a 100 percent â€œfiscal costâ€ to loan guarantees would boost our headline figure to \$7.4 trillion, or 10.8 percent of GDP. Conversely, assigning zero â€œfiscal costâ€ to loan guarantees would lower our headline figure to \$5.3 trillion, or 7.8 percent of GDP. Emerging market (EM) economies have boosted spending but still lag advanced economy (AE) peers by a wide margin: G20 EM fiscal support as of April 29 averages 3.2 percent of GDP, an increase of 1.2 percentage points since April 10 but still well below the average of 11.6 percent for AEs. Chinaâ€™s announcement of 2.3 trillion yuan (\$326 billion) in local government special purpose bond issuance brings its fiscal response to 3.7 percent of GDP, still well below the amount provided during the global financial crisis. Initial data updated through April 10 show the following trends: The largest component of fiscal support is intended to provide financing to businesses: As of April 10, 2020, we estimate G20 countries to have pledged \$5.3 trillion in fiscal support, representing 7.8 percent of 2019 G20 GDP. Of the total, \$2.5 trillion will support credit enhancements (3.7 percent of 2019 G20 GDP), compared to \$2.1 trillion (3.1 percent of GDP) in direct government spending and \$0.6 trillion (0.9 percent) in tax relief. (Our analysis does not include tax deferments.) Almost all support focuses on keeping companies and individuals afloat rather than stimulating new demand and investment, which will become the priority when health restrictions ease. Direct government spending is higher than levels during the global financial crisis (GFC), so far: The 3.1 percent of G20 2019 GDP in direct government spending compares to 2.5 percent of G20 GDP in 2008-2009 â€œcrisis-related discretionary measuresâ€ in response to the GFC. By the end of the pandemic, G20 countries will likely have spent far more than they did in the GFC as a percent of GDP. G20 countries have responded faster than during the GFC: In response to the pandemic, G20 governments announced nearly 8 percent of GDP in fiscal support between early February and early April, with more expected in the coming weeks and months. During the GFC, governmentsâ€™ responses were more protracted: in the United States, the epicenter of the GFC, the Economic Stimulus Act was signed into law in February 2008; the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, which included government funding for the purchase of troubled assets from financial institutions, was signed in October 2008; and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which authorized significant government spending, was signed in February 2009. Thus far, Chinaâ€™s fiscal response is more limited than during the GFC: Chinaâ€™s fiscal support as of April 10 amounts to roughly 1.3 percent of GDP, primarily through loans for impacted businesses and tax relief. This spending at the national level is far lower than the nearly 13 percent of GDP in fiscal spending (inclusive of local, provincial, and national spending) China announced in November 2008 in response to the GFC. Chinese officials have recently signaled they could provide additional stimulus later this year as the health situation stabilizes, but a desire to avoid adding to already high total debt levels will likely limit potential spending. EM economies are more constrained: As a percent of GDP, EM members of the G20 have announced far less fiscal support than AE G20 peers, reflecting, in part, more binding financing constraints. G20 EM fiscal support as of April 10 averages 2 percent of GDP versus 11.7 percent among G20 AEs. Many EMs are at an earlier stage of the pandemic relative to many AEs and may need international support to finance necessary relief measures. Notes: In addition to national efforts detailed above, the European Union has announced several responses: a 37 billion euro (\$40 billion) Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative and a 540 billion euro (\$586 billion) aid package to support member states. Both are not included in the \$6.3 trillion G20 total. Of the \$6.3 trillion of fiscal relief announced by G20 countries as of April 29, about \$45 billion was not itemized as credit enhancement, government spending, or tax relief. This analysis focuses on major, national, discretionary responses in G20 countries and thus does not reflect the full extent of support deployed by these countries in response to Covid-19, such as monetary and regulatory tools (rate cuts, repurchase operations, quantitative easing), automatic spending mechanisms, and additional support from subnational government. We include tax cuts and cancellations in tax relief but do not assign a monetary value to tax deferrals, where possible.

  abstract = {The main argument of this paper is that progress towards gender equality and women's empowerment in the development agenda requires a human rights-based approach, and requires support for the women's movement to activate and energize the agenda. Both are missing from Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 3. Empowerment requires agency along multiple dimensionsâ€”sexual, reproductive, economic, political, and legal. However, MDG 3 frames women's empowerment as reducing educational disparities. By omitting other rights and not recognizing the multiple interdependent and indivisible human rights of women, the goal of empowerment is distorted and â€œdevelopment silosâ€ are created. Women's organizations are key actors in pushing past such distortions and silos at all levels, and hence crucial to pushing the gender equality agenda forward. However, the politics of agenda setting also influences funding priorities such that financial support for women's organizations and for substantive women's empowerment projects is limited. To re-focus the post-2015 Development Agenda around human rights, we conclude by outlining an approach of issue-based goals and people-focused targets, which makes substantive space for civil society including women's rights organizations.},

During the 10 year period between 2002 and 2011, as many as 57 countries have zero or only one poverty estimate. This paper refers to such lack of poverty data as â€œdata deprivation,â€ because the poor are often socially marginalized and voiceless, and the collection of objective and quantitative data is crucial in locating them and formulating policy to help them exit extreme deprivation. This paper studies the extent of data deprivation and proposes targets for ending data deprivation by 2030â€”the year by when the international community aims to end extreme poverty. According to the analysis in this paper, this target is ambitious but possible, and achieving it is necessary to be able to declare the end of extreme poverty with confidence.},

  abstract = {This paper advances a new approach to conceptualise, define and systematically measure women's empowerment. A review of literature identified that empowerment is multidimensional, and that women empowered in one dimension are not necessarily empowered in the other. It was also established that women need both resources and a sense of agency to independently achieve their livelihood outcomes. Therefore, it was concluded that both agency and resources are the best indicators of women's level of empowerment. In view of the multidimensional nature of women's empowerment, this study proposed the use of principal component analysis (PCA) on women's level of agency and resources to generate factor scores (i.e., indicators of each woman's level of empowerment) at each dimension of empowerment (i.e., indicated by each PC) as the better approach to quantitatively measure women's empowerment. Data to test this approach was taken from rural women in Msinga Local Municipality of South Africa. Application of PCA, showed the dominant dimensions in which women in the study area were empowered while the PC factor loadings quantitatively measured the level of empowerment along each dimension. It was concluded that women's empowerment is best conceptualised as increases in women's capabilities and hence, application of PCA to the indicators of women's indicators of resources and agency is the most suitable approach to capture their empowerment levels across different dimensions.},

As the pursuit of better numbers moves the wheel, the article suggests the need to learn more about authority and power in these dynamics by looking at how errors are a practical, accepted, and ubiquitous element in donorsâ€™ practices.},

This article argues that because of increasing forms of public contestation, the broadening agenda of the G8 and G20 and the uncertain status of global cooperation, that the legitimacy of the â€˜Gâ€™ system is being questioned. As such, it is appropriate to consider deliberative avenues whereby public views could be considered by the G20 in a systematic way to foster forms of accountability. This consideration is animated by deliberative democracy theory and republican theory which advance a normative agenda which seeks to transform governance structures by enhancing the role of deliberation and public reasoning in political life. The article outlines the development of the â€˜Gâ€™ systemâ€™s legitimacy, considers possible modes of accountability and public involvement with respect to the G20 and examines the implications of more formalised public deliberation with respect to the G20.},

Critical voices such as the International Council for Science (ICSU), however, have expressed concerns about the potential incompatibility of the SDGs, specifically the incompatibility of socio-economic development and environmental sustainability. In this paper, we test, quantify and model the alleged inconsistency of SDGs. Our analyses show which SDGs are consistent and which are conflicting. We measure the extent of inconsistency and conclude that the SDG agenda will fail as a whole if we continue with business as usual. We further explore the nature of the inconsistencies using dynamical systems models, which reveal that the focus on economic growth and consumption as a means for development underlies the inconsistency. Our models also show that there are factors which can contribute to development (health programmes, government investment) on the one hand and ecological sustainability (renewable energy) on the other, without triggering the conflict between incompatible SDGs.},

These 17 goals and 169 targets set out an agenda for sustainable development for all nations that embraces economic growth, social inclusion, and environmental protection. Now, the agenda moves from agreeing the goals to implementing and ultimately achieving them. Across the goals, 42 targets focus on means of implementation, and the final goal, Goal 17, is entirely devoted to means of implementation. However, these implementation targets are largely silent about interlinkages and interdependencies among goals. This leaves open the possibility of perverse outcomes and unrealised synergies. We demonstrate that there must be greater attention on interlinkages in three areas: across sectors (e.g., finance, agriculture, energy, and transport), across societal actors (local authorities, government agencies, private sector, and civil society), and between and among low, medium and high income countries. Drawing on a global sustainability science and practice perspective, we provide seven recommendations to improve these interlinkages at both global and national levels, in relation to the UNâ€™s categories of means of implementation: finance, technology, capacity building, trade, policy coherence, partnerships, and, finally, data, monitoring and accountability.},

  abstract = {In this paper we critically examine the concept of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC). It proposes that there is an inverted U-shape relation between environmental degradation and income per capita, so that, eventually, growth reduces the environmental impact of economic activity. The concept is dependent on a model of the economy in which there is no feedback from the quality of the environment to production possibilities, and in which trade has a neutral effect on environmental degradation. The actual violation of these assumptions gives rise to fundamental problems in estimating the parameters of an EKC. The paper identifies other econometric problems with estimates of the EKC, and reviews a number of empirical studies. The inference from some such EKC estimates that further development will reduce environmental degradation is dependent on the assumption that world per capita income is normally distributed when in fact median income is far below mean income. We carry out simulations combining EKC estimates from the literature with World Bank forecasts for economic growth for individual countries, aggregating over countries to derive the global impact. Within the horizon of the Bank's forecast (2025) global emissions of SO2 continue to increase. Forest loss stabilizes before the end of the period but tropical deforestation continues at a constant rate throughout the period.},

Such pressure comes from major donors and from international non-governmental organisations (NGOs) obliged to have an external assessment but who then maintain a high degree of confidentiality and control. That such experiences are widespread reflects the deeply political nature of the field of â€˜global healthâ€™ and the interconnections between priority setting, policy making and project implementation, which sit within a broader set of deeply entrenched power structures.2 3 Researchers in this field routinely find themselves working withinâ€”and studyingâ€”complex power relations and so experience challenges in negotiating their own position between interests of commissioning agencies and funders, implementers and country governments, as well as those of their own research institutions and their partnerships with other researchers spanning high-income, middle-income and low-income countries.4â€“7 They often receive research funding from major donor agencies like the UK Department of International Development (DFID), the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the Agence FranÃ§aise de DÃ©veloppement (AFD), UNITAID and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,8 who commission evaluations for their own funded projects, even though they have â€¦},

All rights reserved.1. IntroductionThe ongoing global pandemic has been both a health crisis andeconomic calamity. The United States Federal Reserve swiftly back-stopped the dollar system with 14 swap agreements and a repofacility. But these efforts were not extended to all but a handfulof Emerging Market and Developing Economies (EMDEs). As aresult, investors fled to this new safety for the dollar and thelargest-ever capital outflows from EMDEs were recorded, leavingmost struggling to defend their currencies, support economicactivity, and invest in necessary health and social infrastructures.Both the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the UnitedNations Conference on Trade and Development estimate thatEMDEs require \$2.5tn to meet immediate financing needs (IMF,2020o; UNCTAD, 2020).Where can countries turn to receive such support? This is thetask of the global financial safety net, a web of â€˜financial resourcesand institutional arrangements that provide a backstop during afinancial or economic crisisâ€™ (Hawkins et al., 2014, p. 2). Notably,this includes central banksâ€™ bilateral swap lines and countriesâ€™ for-eign reserves. The former is only available to a handful of countries.The latter have been dwindling since the onset of the pandemicwith attempts by governments to defend their currencies in lightof capital outflows. Consequently, countries increasingly have nochoice but to seek financial support from the third global financialsafety net pillar: multilateral financial institutions. These encom-pass the IMF and regional financial arrangements (RFAs), like theChiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization or Latin American ReserveFund (Kring \& Gallagher, 2019).This article has two objectives. First, we examine recent policypromises on expanding the global financial safety net and comparethese to pre-pandemic available resources. Second, we presentdata that offer an initial look into what the IMF and RFAs have beendoing: which countries have benefited, what level of financing hasbeen approved, and under what terms? To meet these objectives,we rely on official pronouncements of these institutions and onnewly-developed datasets of lending activities.

Disparaging analysis suggests that there exists a potential inconsistency in the SDGs, particularly between the socio-economic development and the environmental sustainability goals. Critiques also raise questions on the measurability and monitoring of the broadly framed SDGs. The goals are non-binding, with each country being expected to create their own national or regional plans. Moreover, the source(s) and the extent of the financial resources and investments for the SDGs are ambiguous. This chapter quantifies and examines the inconsistencies of the SDGs. It further inspects which of the underlying social, economic or environmental pillars are that most effective for achieving sustainable development. Analyses of the data reveal that the developed countries need to remain focused on their social and environmental policies. The developing countries, on the other hand, are better off being focused on their economics and social policies in the short run, even though environmental policies remain significant for sustainable development.},

The motivation behind the study stems from the renewed interest in inequality in academia, public discourse, and in global policy. First, we argue that inequality should be considered when constructing development indicators. The role of distribution in development is important both because people generally prefer lower inequality and inequality tends to have negative effects on development outcomes. Second, we analyze how ten selected development indicators account for inequality (in terms of justification, type of inequality, measure of inequality, and method of incorporation) and what the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches are. We found considerable diversity especially for inequality measures and methods of incorporation. As for the type of inequality, inequality of opportunities is considered marginally and overlapping inequalities not at all; increasing data availability opens the door for inclusion especially for the latter aspect. As most indicators suffer from insufficient methodological substantiation, we argue for increased clarity regarding why and how inequality is accounted for in development indicators. The analysis is complemented by a detailed review of treatment of inequality by the analyzed indicators (Annex).},

This composite measure, which we call the Patriarchy Index, combines a range of variables related to familial behavior that reflect varying degrees of sex- and age-related social inequality across different family settings. We demonstrate the comparative advantages of the index by showing how 266 historical populations from the Atlantic coast of Europe to Moscow scored on the patriarchy scale. We then compare the index with contemporary measures of gender discrimination, and find a strong correlation between historical and current inequality patterns. Finally, we explore how variation in patriarchy levels across Europe is related to the socioeconomic and institutional characteristics of the regional populations, and to variation across these regions in their degree of demographic centrality and environmental conditions. The results confirm previous findings that family organization is a crucial generator of social inequality, and point to the importance of considering the historical context when analyzing the current global contours of inequality.},

  abstract = {BSTRACT Discussions on the politics of Chinese engagement with African development have been marked by increasing concern over Chinese use of aid in exchange for preferential energy deals. Normative liberal discourse criticizes the Chinese for disbursing 'rogue aid' and undermining good governance in the African continent. These criticisms not only ignore the longer-term motivations and modalities of Chinese aid and the historical diversity of Chinese relations with Africa, but also uncritically assume 'Western' aid to be morally 'superior' and 'more effective' in terms of development outcomes. This paper consists of three parts. First, it will discuss the debates surrounding Chinese engagement in Africa, especially around aid and development issues. Second, the paper maps the historical development of China-Africa engagement and investigates the impacts of the changing modalities of Chinese aid with reference to case studies of two countries: Angola and Ghana. It then offers a comparative analysis of the similarities and differences between these two cases. The principal argument is that Chinese and Western donors employ different ideologies and practices of governance to conceal their own interests and political discourses in the African continent.},

  abstract = {Human capital is identified as one of the main determinants of economic growth and plays an important role in the technological progress of countries. Nevertheless, existing studies have to some extent neglected the importance of human capital in the growth process via the interaction it can have with a countryâ€™s industrial specialization. Additionally, the emphasis is mainly placed on supply-side determinants, while demand-side factors are neglected, particularly the relevance of the processes of structural change. Thus, using a growth model which integrates variables from both the supply side and demand side, we assess the direct and indirect effects of human capital on economic growth, including in the latter the interaction of human capital with the industrial specialization of countries. Based on dynamic panel data estimations, we found that human capital and the countriesâ€™ productive specialization dynamics are crucial factors for economic growth. Moreover, the interaction between human capital and structural change in high knowledge-intensive industries impacts significantly on economic growth. However, the sign of this effect depends on the type of country and the period of analysis. Specifically, over a longer time span (1960â€“2011) and for more highly developed (OECD) countries, the impact of the interaction between human capital and structural change is positive. When we also include transition and Mediterranean countries over a shorter time period (1990â€“2011), we find that human capital significantly and positively impacts on the countriesâ€™ economic growth but the effect of human capital via specialization in high-tech and knowledge-intensive activities is negative. The latter result indicates that the lack of industrial structures able to properly integrate highly educated individuals into the productive system leads countries to experience disappointing economic returns.},

  abstract = {Infrastructure systems form the backbone of every society, providing essential services that include energy, water, waste management, transport and telecommunications. Infrastructure can also create harmful social and environmental impacts, increase vulnerability to natural disasters and leave an unsustainable burden of debt. Investment in infrastructure is at an all-time high globally, thus an ever-increasing number of decisions are being made now that will lock-in patterns of development for future generations. Although for the most part these investments are motivated by the desire to increase economic productivity and employment, we find that infrastructure either directly or indirectly influences the attainment of all of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including 72\% of the targets. We categorize the positive and negative effects of infrastructure and the interdependencies between infrastructure sectors. To ensure that the right infrastructure is built, policymakers need to establish long-term visions for sustainable national infrastructure systems, informed by the SDGs, and develop adaptable plans that can demonstrably deliver their vision.},

  abstract = {The paper examines the level and changes in female and male participation rates, employment segregation and female relative to male wages across the world economy. It finds sufficient evidence to support the view that labor markets in developing countries are transformed relatively quickly in the sense that gender differentials in employment and pay are narrowing much faster than they did in industrialized countries. The paper evaluates the inefficiencies arising from persisting gender differentials in the labor market and finds them to be potentially significant. The estimates also indicate that the resulting deadweight losses are borne primarily by women while men gain mainly in relative terms â€” there are no real winners from discrimination. The paper concludes that growth benefits women at large, inequalities can have significantly adverse effects on welfare, and market-based development alone can be a weak instrument for reducing inequality between the sexes. To break the vicious circle of women's low initial human capital endowments and inferior labor market outcomes compared to men's, the paper proposes greater access of girls to education and of women to training, enforceable equal pay and equal employment opportunities legislation, a taxation and benefits structure that treats reproduction as an economic activity and women as equal partners within households, and a better accounting of women's work to include invisible production.},

The significant transformation that has occurred in recent decades has given greater understanding and recognition to the role of urbanization in development. However, the issues around housing have not received sufficient attention within the urbanization process. Compounded by rapid population growth and remaining high levels of poverty, cities in the developing world are facing persistent challenges to meet their housing needs. Not only the lack of adequate housing is enormous, but in many countries the stock of vacant houses increases even when millions of people have nowhere to live. Housing affordability has become a global crisis with strong negative impact on the wellbeing of people and on the exacerbation of urban inequality. One of the worst global economic crises of last decades had housing at its epicentre, entrenched in a combination of aggressive financing and ownership models that stressed speculation over social welfare.},

How we envisage and share our urban spaces ultimately impacts how we address global challenges, and it is in our cities, towns, and villages where actions must be prioritized and operationalized.

The Habitat III Conference and its preparatory process provided a unique opportunity to bring together diverse urban actors, including local authorities and the United Nations system expertise, to contribute to the development of the New Urban Agenda in the new global development context after the historic adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Goals, the Paris Agreement on climate change, and other global development agreements and frameworks. In September 2014, during the first session of the Habitat III Preparatory Committee (PrepCom 1) held in New York at the United Nations headquarters, the Secretary-General of the Conference, Dr. Joan Clos, presented a report1 on the preparations for the Conference and launched an innovative, inclusive, and action-oriented preparatory process carried out in four areas: knowledge, engagement, policy, and operations. The Secretary-General of the Conference also expressed his intention to create the United Nations Task Team on Habitat III as an inter-agency group in which focal points of several United Nations system would coordinate system-wide preparations towards Habitat III. The Habitat III Strategic Framework was developed based on these aforementioned four areas, while linkages among the four areas were guided by the principles of innovation and inclusiveness requested by Member States. The Habitat III Issue Papers were identified as one of the first outcomes in the knowledge area of the Strategic Framework, and the United Nations Task Team on Habitat III was invited to develop them.},

  abstract = {The city is the home of prosperity. It is the place where human beings find satisfaction of basic needs and access to essential public goods. The city is also where ambitions, aspirations and other material and immaterial aspects of life are realized, providing contentment and happiness. It is a locus at which the prospects of prosperity and individual and collective well-being can be increased. What this new edition of State of the world's cities shows is that prosperity for all has been compromised by a narrow focus on economic growth. UN-Habitat suggests a fresh approach to prosperity beyond the solely economic emphasis, including other vital dimensions such as quality of life, adequate infrastructures, equity and environmental sustainability. The Report proposes a new tool - the City Prosperity Index - together with a conceptual matrix, the Wheel of Prosperity, both of which are meant to assist decision makers to design clear policy interventions. The Report advocates for the need of cities to enhance the public realm, expand public goods and consolidate rights to the 'commons' for all as a way to expand prosperity. This comes in response to the observed trend of enclosing or restricting these goods and commons in enclaves of prosperity, or depleting them through unsustainable use. - Publisher.},

  abstract = {The Article distinguishes different approaches to conceptualising gender and poverty through examining the challenges of intersecting inequalities. Three dilemmas relating to whether one prioritises what works or what matters in poverty reduction are considered. The first dilemma is entailed in translating between different contexts of public policy formation, professional work, and lived experience in relation to gender and poverty. Is â€˜what worksâ€™ achieved at the expense of â€˜what mattersâ€™? The second arises from a problem of attempting to build transversal dialogues across differently situated actors and the extent to which building a process of understanding of â€˜what mattersâ€™ is enough to go beyond advocacy to selecting the appropriate action. The last is the dilemma of prioritisation. Is it more important to address poverty and gender sequentially or in tandem? Taking examples drawn from a research project on the interpretation of the gender Millennium Development Goal (MDG3) in Kenya and South Africa, and drawing on some of the conceptual resources associated with Amartya Sen's comparative approach to justice, the analysis attempts to address some of the challenges of the relationship of what works, what matters and the complexity of intersecting injustices.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTIONDevelopment indicators constitute a technology of global governance because of their knowledge and their governance effects. The knowledge effect is determined by the underlying development theory that is promoted by both indicator users and generators, which may be articulated through an economic, an institutional, or a rights-based frame of reference. The increased use of expert knowledge in the development field has encouraged the use of indicators as a proxy for development not only by hegemonic institutions, such as the World Bank, but also by other indicator users or generators that seek to contest the development â€œcommonsense.â€ The World Bank remains one of the most important producers and users of indicators, and through its World Development Indicators (WDI) it has managed to promote hegemonic theories of development based on economics-based frames of reference. Although the World Bank has expanded its development discourse to include concerns of institutions and rights-based approaches, it has continuously relied on economic indicators as the main tool to measure development.Once the knowledge that is being promoted by the development indicator is established, it becomes easier to unveil the production of standards and identities that are being shaped in the development field as a result of the use of a specific indicator. The development knowledge disseminated by the indicator in turn shapes the outcome of its governance effect. As described in the third section, indicators can have a wide range of effects on global governance; however, the most common ones for the development field are the regulatory effect and the allocation of responsibilities. The regulatory effect should be understood as a type of governance at a distance, as â€œindicator usersâ€ can influence the performance of â€œindicator targetsâ€ by sending signals of the kind of society that is expected from developed societies, This effect increases when performance indicators are used to allocate aid based on the economic incentive.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTIONThis chapter explores some of the ways in which indicators interact with law. Accordingly, it studies the Rule of Law Index, an indicator developed and applied by the World Justice Project to measure the adherence of almost 200 countries to the rule of law. Such quantitative technologies of measurement, this chapter argues, are here to stay in the law and development agenda. They create a community of practice and provide normative criteria for the evaluation of whether a country adheres to their particular idea of what the rule of law is (and is not). Because of their origin in multilateral financial institutions, the Index and other rule of law indicators tend to be seen by some as implausible neoliberal simplifications that simply should be dismissed. This chapter takes a different perspective. Irrespective of the Index's origins, the genie is out of the bottle. Rule of law indicators are veritable technologies of global governance, and it is therefore important to engage with them, as they open a space for contestation, intervention, and policy debate on what it means to encourage the rule of law in the developing world.The chapter is organized in three parts. The first one puts the Index in context and argues that it can be read as an expression of a post-neoliberal moment of the law and development agenda. The second part unpacks the Index itselfâ€“ its added-value and methodologyâ€“ and proposes a characterization of the notion of rule of law that underlies it. According to this section, the â€œrule of lawâ€ of the Index is substantive, non instrumental, and features a certain realist sensibility. Building on these premises, in the third part I rethink the role that the Index, and other rule of law indicators like it, play in global governance. The fourth part concludes the chapter.},

  abstract = {Previous studies have demonstrated that N,N-diethyldithiocarbamate (DEDC) elevates copper and promotes oxidative stress within the nervous system. However, whether these effects resolve following cessation of exposure or have the potential to persist and result in cumulative injury has not been determined. In this study, an established model for DEDC myelin injury in the rat was used to determine whether copper levels, oxidative stress, and neuromuscular deficits resolve following the cessation of DEDC exposure. Rats were exposed to DEDC for 8 weeks and then either euthanized or maintained for 2, 6 or 12 weeks after cessation of exposure. At each time point copper levels were measured by inductively coupled mass spectrometry to assess the ability of sciatic nerve, brain, spinal cord and liver to eliminate excess copper post-exposure. The protein expression levels of glutathione transferase alpha, heme oxygenase 1 and superoxide dismutase 1 in peripheral nerve and brain were also determined by western blot to assess levels of oxidative stress as a function of post-exposure duration. As an initial assessment of the bioavailability of the excess copper in brain the protein expression levels of copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase 1, and prion protein were determined by western blot as a function of exposure and post-exposure duration. Neuromuscular function in peripheral nerve was evaluated using grip strengths, nerve conduction velocities, and morphologic changes at the light microscope level. The data demonstrated that in peripheral nerve, copper levels and oxidative stress return to control levels within several weeks after cessation of exposure. Neuromuscular function also showed a trend towards pre-exposure values, although the resolution of myelin lesions was more delayed. In contrast, total copper and antioxidant enzyme levels remained significantly elevated in brain for longer post-exposure periods. The persistence of effects observed in brain suggests that the central nervous system is more susceptible to long-term cumulative adverse effects from dithiocarbamates. Additionally, significant changes in expression levels of chaperone for superoxide dismutase 1, and prion protein were observed consistent with at least a portion of the excess copper being bioactive.},

  abstract = {China's increasing role as a provider of overseas aid is the subject of considerable debate both within and outside of China. However, despite research activity examining how Chinese aid is materialized, very little is actually known about why Chinese aid projects are developed or implemented the way they are. Although recent indications suggest the Chinese government is increasingly willing to be more open about overseas aid, for example, the release of the first White Paper on Foreign Aid in 2011, external observers remain largely unaware of the values, goals and motivations behind Chinese aid projects. Alongside this lack of information, non-Chinese analyses tend to be founded on a Realist approach to understanding international relations in which a "rising power" such as China automatically constitutes a threat to existing power relations. As a result, many scholars conclude that China's aid is part of a strategic quest to further its own geopolitical ends. This paper provides insights into the contentious topic of the drivers behind Chinese overseas development assistance. It finds that Chinese elites in the international development sphere do not share the views prevalent in Western international relations discourse about the international system and China's role within it.This article argues that exploring Chinese development actors' and commentators' conceptions of what development means, along with their views on China's role and obligations within the international system, allows a better understanding of the motivations behind Chinese aid, and a reexamination of some of the misconceptions around Chinese aid as a tool of Chinese geopolitical strategy.},

In these countries, the median mortality ratio between the ethnic groups with the highest and lowest U5MRs was 3Â·3 (IQR 2Â·1â€“5Â·2; range 1Â·5â€“8Â·5), whereas among the remaining 11 countries, the median U5MR ratio was 1Â·9 (IQR 1Â·7â€“2Â·5; range 1Â·4â€“10Â·0). Ethnic gaps were wider for child mortality than for neonatal or post-neonatal mortality.

The long-term character of climate change and the high costs of adaptation measures, in combination with their uncertain effects, turn climate adaptation governance into a torturous process. We systematically review the literature on climate adaptation governance to analyze the scholarly understanding of these complexities. Building on governance literature about long-term and complex policy problems, we develop a conceptual matrix based on the dimensions knowledge and power to systematically study the peer-reviewed literature on climate adaptation governance. We find that about a quarter of the reviewed journal articles do not address the knowledge or power dimension of the governance of climate change adaptation, about half of the articles discuss either the knowledge or the power dimension, and another quarter discuss both knowledge and power. The articles that do address both knowledge and power (1) conceptualize the governance of climate adaptation mainly as a complex system of regulatory frameworks and technical knowledge, (2) assume that regulatory systems can be easily adapted to new knowledge, (3) pay little attention to fluid or unorganized forms of power, e.g., negotiation, and knowledge, e.g., learning, and (4) largely neglect the interplay between the two. We argue that more research on this interplay is needed, and we discuss how puzzling and powering are a promising pair of concepts to study this.},

However, the potential for socioeconomic representation to benefit those from a lower socioeconomic background has not been thoroughly explored. Using the Early Childhood Longitudinal Studyâ€”Kindergarten Cohort 2011 and a student fixed-effects approach, I begin to fill this gap in the literature by investigating whether socioeconomic representationâ€”above and beyond and intersecting with racial and ethnic representationâ€”affects teachers' perceptions of their relationships with students. Heterogeneity by an organizational context likely to affect the saliency of SES is also explored. Overall results show no evidence that SES match between teachers and students influences teachers' rating of relationship quality with students. For low-SES black students, racial representation persists as an important factor in better teacherâ€“student relationships, even controlling for socioeconomic representation. However, for low-SES white students in contexts where SES is likely to be particularly salient, socioeconomic representation has a significant positive effect on teacherâ€“student relationship quality. Results exploring the interaction of racial and socioeconomic representation are also presented. Finally, theoretical and practical implications, as well as directions for future research, are discussed.},

  abstract = {The study of transparency is increasingly a more topical, broadly relevant, but also more under-researched enterprise. The Asian financial crisis has highlighted not only the welfare consequences of financial sector transparency, sparking a series of yet unresolved debates, but has also linked this relatively narrow problem to the broader context of transparency in governance. Its significance has broadened geographically as well as across different sectors. It has been observed that curtailment of transparency, often on scanty pretexts, is commonplace even in the highly developed countries. This suggests a broad and possibly radical reform agenda. Departing from the urgency of these observations, this paper reviews the existing literature on transparency in finance and governance, indicates remaining knowledge gaps, and offers some hypothesis on the mutual significance of the two issues. The first two sections of the paper outlines a conceptual framework for defining and measuring transparency that distinguishes among its desirable characteristics; access, timeliness, relevance, and quality. It also suggests methodologies that may produce tractable measures of transparency. Additionally, it places in context debates concerning transparency; its desirability, contingency, complexity and regulation. Reviewing critiques of objections against disclosure, the chapter advances a general preference for transparency, not only in the developing but also in the developed world. Nevertheless, it emphasizes the need to weigh the costs and benefits of more transparency in designing regulatory policy. In general, while consequences of information imperfections are well recognized, the solution is not simply a matter of more information. The third section treats the role of transparency in promoting greater financial stability, acknowledging exceptions to the general preference expressed earlier, in relation to financial stability. It treats as priority policy issues the following problems: developing institutional infrastructure, developing standards and accounting practices, improving incentives for disclosure and balancing countervailing regulations to minimize perverse incentives generated by safety net arrangements such as deposit insurance. An important suggestion is that since institutional development is gradual, relatively simple regulations such as limits on credit expansion, may be best tailored to developing countries. Implicit in this section is the notion that there are absolute limits to transparency, in particular for lack of adequate enforcement. The last section elaborates on the concomitant link between financial markets and governance, discussing select consequences of transparency for national-level and local governance, identifying some policy implications and suggesting further research issues. As illustrated by the case of Indonesia, it argues that financial reform may be predicated on broader public sector reforms. Again, because formal institutions take time to develop, it highlights three principles of reform to promote incentives for openness: harnessing private sector participation in service provision, promoting exit and contestability, and encouraging "voice" and public participation. These are now increasingly being integrated to new innovative data collection and analysis techniques, and to particular dissemination methods promoting collective action to improve governance and enhance transparency. The chapter concludes by outlining the difficulties of implementing greater participation and voice.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h2{$>$}Summary{$<$}/h2{$><$}h3{$>$}Background{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}In an era of shifting global agendas and expanded emphasis on non-communicable diseases and injuries along with communicable diseases, sound evidence on trends by cause at the national level is essential. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) provides a systematic scientific assessment of published, publicly available, and contributed data on incidence, prevalence, and mortality for a mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive list of diseases and injuries.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Methods{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}GBD estimates incidence, prevalence, mortality, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) due to 369 diseases and injuries, for two sexes, and for 204 countries and territories. Input data were extracted from censuses, household surveys, civil registration and vital statistics, disease registries, health service use, air pollution monitors, satellite imaging, disease notifications, and other sources. Cause-specific death rates and cause fractions were calculated using the Cause of Death Ensemble model and spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression. Cause-specific deaths were adjusted to match the total all-cause deaths calculated as part of the GBD population, fertility, and mortality estimates. Deaths were multiplied by standard life expectancy at each age to calculate YLLs. A Bayesian meta-regression modelling tool, DisMod-MR 2.1, was used to ensure consistency between incidence, prevalence, remission, excess mortality, and cause-specific mortality for most causes. Prevalence estimates were multiplied by disability weights for mutually exclusive sequelae of diseases and injuries to calculate YLDs. We considered results in the context of the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a composite indicator of income per capita, years of schooling, and fertility rate in females younger than 25 years. Uncertainty intervals (UIs) were generated for every metric using the 25th and 975th ordered 1000 draw values of the posterior distribution.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Findings{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Global health has steadily improved over the past 30 years as measured by age-standardised DALY rates. After taking into account population growth and ageing, the absolute number of DALYs has remained stable. Since 2010, the pace of decline in global age-standardised DALY rates has accelerated in age groups younger than 50 years compared with the 1990â€“2010 time period, with the greatest annualised rate of decline occurring in the 0â€“9-year age group. Six infectious diseases were among the top ten causes of DALYs in children younger than 10 years in 2019: lower respiratory infections (ranked second), diarrhoeal diseases (third), malaria (fifth), meningitis (sixth), whooping cough (ninth), and sexually transmitted infections (which, in this age group, is fully accounted for by congenital syphilis; ranked tenth). In adolescents aged 10â€“24 years, three injury causes were among the top causes of DALYs: road injuries (ranked first), self-harm (third), and interpersonal violence (fifth). Five of the causes that were in the top ten for ages 10â€“24 years were also in the top ten in the 25â€“49-year age group: road injuries (ranked first), HIV/AIDS (second), low back pain (fourth), headache disorders (fifth), and depressive disorders (sixth). In 2019, ischaemic heart disease and stroke were the top-ranked causes of DALYs in both the 50â€“74-year and 75-years-and-older age groups. Since 1990, there has been a marked shift towards a greater proportion of burden due to YLDs from non-communicable diseases and injuries. In 2019, there were 11 countries where non-communicable disease and injury YLDs constituted more than half of all disease burden. Decreases in age-standardised DALY rates have accelerated over the past decade in countries at the lower end of the SDI range, while improvements have started to stagnate or even reverse in countries with higher SDI.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Interpretation{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}As disability becomes an increasingly large component of disease burden and a larger component of health expenditure, greater research and development investment is needed to identify new, more effective intervention strategies. With a rapidly ageing global population, the demands on health services to deal with disabling outcomes, which increase with age, will require policy makers to anticipate these changes. The mix of universal and more geographically specific influences on health reinforces the need for regular reporting on population health in detail and by underlying cause to help decision makers to identify success stories of disease control to emulate, as well as opportunities to improve.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Funding{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Bill \& Melinda Gates Foundation.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

New evidence on the time paths of economic growth, physical capital investment, and openness around episodes of trade policy liberalization is also presented. Analysis based on the new data set suggests that over the 1950â€“98 period, countries that liberalized their trade regimes experienced average annual growth rates that were about 1.5 percentage points higher than before liberalization. Postliberalization investment rates rose 1.5â€“2.0 percentage points, confirming past findings that liberalization fosters growth in part through its effect on physical capital accumulation. Liberalization raised the average trade to GDP ratio by roughly 5 percentage points, suggesting that trade policy liberalization did indeed raise the actual level of openness of liberalizers. However, these average effects mask large differences across countries.},

  abstract = {Many developing and transitional countries have grown faster than advanced countries in the past decade, resulting in a shift in the distribution of world income in their favor. China is now the second largest economy in the world, behind the United States and ahead of Japan. As the relative economic weight of China and several others has come to match or exceed that of the middle-ranking G7 economies, the world economy has shifted from ?unipolar? toward ?multipolar,? less dominated by the G7. How is this change being translated into changes in authority and influence within multilateral organizations like the G20, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)? Alarm bells are ringing in G7 capitals about G7 loss of influence. According to a WikiLeaks cable from the senior U.S. official for the G20 process, from January 2010, ?It is remarkable how closely coordinated the BASIC group of countries [Brazil, South Africa, India, China] have become in international fora, taking turns to impede US/EU initiatives and playing the US and EU off against each other.?This essay suggests that the shift in power is much smaller than the headlines or private alarm bells suggest. The United States remains the dominant state, and the G7 states together continue to exercise primacy, but now more fearfully and defensively. China is split between asserting itself as ?the wave of the future? and defending itself as too poor to take on global responsibilities (it is roughly 100th in the per capita income hierarchy). The combination of G7 defensiveness and emerging states? jealous guarding of sovereignty produces a spirit of Westphalian assertion in international fora, or ?every state for itself.? On the assumption that the world economy is in a transitional period, the article suggests reforms in the G20 and the World Bank that would boost their role and legitimacy as multilateral organizations in a more multipolar world.},

This paper addresses key issues involved in making such an assessment, in particular, the conceptualisation and measurement of gender equality. It starts with a consideration of three different perspectives concerning the conceptualisation of â€œimprovementâ€ as either economic development, human capabilities, or gender equality. This is followed by an analysis of the tensions between three different models of gender equality. The final section is a critical review of the operationalisation of these concepts and the collection of data necessary to assess progress on each of the 12 critical areas of concern of the UN Platform for Action. In particular, what are the best indicators? The paper engages with the development of international standards of gender equality with a focus on their application in the EU region.},

  abstract = {The Central American migrant caravans of 2018 are best understood as having been precipitated by entangled multi-scalar geopolitical histories among the United States, Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. Unsurprisingly, the migrants traveling north to the United States garnered widespread attention on social media. So much so that the reaction to the caravan accelerated plans to deploy troops to the US southern border and deny Central Americans the opportunity to seek asylum. This example showcases how the digital world can have exponential material effects. While coverage on border security and migration has been extensive, within political geography, such concerns have rarely been paired with social media. In this article, we take as our object of analysis the digitality or â€œdigital lifeâ€ of the migrant caravan. Mapping the patterns of migrant caravan-related tweeting paired with the exploration of Twitterâ€™s networked dimensions reveals the platform to be a fundamentally spatial technology. Rather than reflect, refract or distort, Twitter produces and (its power) is in turn produced through spatial mechanisms. We present multiple cartographic visualizations in support of this claim and highlight the ways in which a contextual knowledge of the subject under studyâ€”the migrant caravanâ€”can further inform analyses of Big Data.},

Drawing from the case of the World Bank as a â€œfirst mover,â€ this chapter examines the complex internal processes and factors that shape the adoption and implementation of access to information policy reforms.

  abstract = {In this article, I develop a critical analysis of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) agenda and its commitment to â€˜leave no one behindâ€™. The Preamble to the Resolution on the SDGs adopted by the United Nations General Assembly stated the following: â€˜We are resolved to free the human race from the tyranny of poverty and want and to heal and secure our planet. (. . .) As we embark on this collective journey, we pledge that no one will be left behindâ€™. Through a close examination of the SDG initiativeâ€”and aligned concrete policy proposalsâ€”I demonstrate that the project to â€˜leave no one behindâ€™ rests on specific ideological premises: it is designed to promote and consolidate a highly contested neo-liberal variant of capitalist development. The SDGs are framed as a universal project, with quite substantial institutional monitoring mechanisms aimed at ensuring the successful implementation of aligned policies. Indeed, as I demonstrate, the implementation of highly contested neoliberal policies are themselves explicit goals of the SDG agenda. In this respect, the SDGs differ significantly from the Millennium Development Goal initiative. The argument I develop demonstrates that the SDG agenda may be aimed in part at undermining political struggles that aspire for more socially just and ecologically sustainable approaches to development. Overall, I argue that the explicit commitment to â€˜leave no one behindâ€™ is a discourse that is strategically deployed to justify the implementation of a highly problematic political project as the framework of global development. This is a framework that privileges commercial interests over commitments to provide universal entitlements to address fundamental life-sustaining needs. Political struggles over development will continue against the ideology of the SDG project and for transformative shifts for actually sustainable development.},

The aim of the paper is to set out a basic framework for exploring this further. Noting many continuities with colonial formations, it identifies three critical dimensions of development which need to be interrogated: its material outcomes; its techniques of transformation; and its modes of knowing. Its analysis of race emphasises the diversity of understandings and the fluidity between them which underlie both their potential for transformation and their resilience. Following Omi and Winant's work on the USA, development is suggested to comprise a process of racial formation, made up of a vast range of diverse and contradictory racial projects which link the meaning of ethnic, racial and national identities to material entitlements.},

Efforts are being made by NGOs, United Nations Agencies and to a lesser extent the donor community, but these efforts are fragmented.Practical implications - If logistics in humanitarian relief is supported and valued the effectiveness and predictability of humanitarian response will improve. Even small improvements in efficiency in logistics will result in significant savings in logistics costs.Originality value - There is little published in logistics for humanitarian relief and disseminating the importance of logistics in humanitarian aid and the challenges it faces will assist the donor community, the NGOs and the field logisticians in raising the profile of logistics.},

This paper tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.},

A large proportion of total global impacts can be associated with trade, and the trend is rising. Advances in global multi-region input-output models have allowed researchers to draw detailed, international supply-chain connections between harmful production in social and environmental hotspots and affluent consumption in global centres of wealth. The general direction of impact displacement is from developed to developing countriesâ€”an increase of health impacts in China from air pollution linked to export production for the United States being one prominent example. The relocation of production across countries counteracts national mitigation policies and may negate ostensible achievements in decoupling impacts from economic growth. A comprehensive implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals therefore requires the inclusion of footprint indicators to avoid loopholes in national sustainability assessments.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses some of the methodological issues in the measurement of ethnicity in the social survey. Measurement encounters two sets of interrelated problems: those of the definition and nature of ethnicity as a social phenomenon and its individual subjective experience and those of the derivation of valid and reliable categories. Commonly used single-item measures fail to capture many ethnic groups and may be of limited value. Extending categories in these will capture more groups, but can be unwieldy and produce small cell counts, whereas multiple measures can be more successful, but are practically less viable in general surveys. We conclude that whilst these difficulties are probably insurmountable, a strategy that is sensitive to the presence of ethnic groups in particular localities is a way forward, but this should also be part of a more sociologically nuanced approach to the collection of ethnic data.},

Such a focus can be integrated in a more meaningful way through the application of a theoretical model that provides a framework for understanding the role of race and ethnicity at multiple levels, and through recognition of challenges and limitations related to measurement and methodological approaches. Greater attention to race and ethnicity in research on youth programs can provide insight into the relevance of PYD models for specific groups of youth, culturally-specific themes that might enhance the applicability of PYD models and programs for some groups, the role of within-group heterogeneity with respect to PYD outcomes, and the aspects of PYD models and programs that appear to be essential for all youth across sociocultural contexts.},

We critique some of the Transforming Our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development â€˜follow-up and reviewâ€™ arrangements for the health goal, SDG3. To assist in this analysis, we draw from a tripartite conceptualisation of accountability and focus particularly on monitoring and review. We use a human rights framework to explore whether the agreed SDG3 indicators for â€˜follow-up and reviewâ€™ promote the collection of data that could demonstrate health rights entitlements are being respected, protected and fulfilled. We find there are gaps through which breaches of human rights could fall undetected, especially around participation and quality health care. We find statistics are frequently absent in countries and communities most â€˜left behindâ€™, and suggestions that Big Data could fill these statistical gaps ignore the realities of poor information systems and the digital divide. We conclude that well resourced countries have human rights obligations to provide assistance where needed to national statistics offices to improve their capacity to contribute to human rights accountability mechanisms.},

This is explored through development discourses and practices relating to microfinance, reproductive rights and adolescent girls. Drawing on examples from India, the article goes on to reflect on experiences of collective movements in which the assumptions underpinning this â€˜Gender Equality as Smart Economicsâ€™ approach are challenged. Finally, it highlights several concepts associated with Marxist, Black, Post-colonial and Queer feminisms and underlines their importance to projects seeking to critically redefine development, arguing for a radical re-appropriation of gender in this context.},

The purpose of this paper is first, to explore these shortcomings within the peer-reviewed literature and, second, propose a starting point for a solution with a decentralized humanitarian aid deployment (DHAD) framework. Design/methodology/approach The authors conducted a focused, qualitative review of available and relevant literature. Findings The literature reviewed demonstrates that current centralized humanitarian aid deployment models lack meaningful engagement of local assets while indicating a plausible connection between these same models and disaster urbanization. Next, the literature shows introducing a new decentralized model could represent a sustainable aid deployment standard for that countryâ€™s specific response, recovery, mitigation and planning opportunities and constraints. Research limitations/implications The next step is to develop a working DHAD model for a lower-income country using a multi-layered, GIS analysis that incorporates some or all of the socioeconomic and environmental variables suggested herein. Practical implications The practical potential of the DHAD framework includes establishing the impacted country in the lead role of their own recovery at the moment of deployment, no longer relying on foreign logistics models to sort it out once aid has arrived. Originality/value This paper discusses a topic that much of the literature agrees requires more research while suggesting a new conceptual framework for aid deployment best practices which is also largely absent from the literature.},

This study investigates the attributes and effectiveness of donor-supported programmes and projects that worked well under difficult conditions in fragile states. Presented in this study are nine development initiatives in six less developed countries - Afghanistan, Cambodia, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, Timor Leste and Uganda. The cases show that development initiatives, which engage local communities and local level governments, are often able to have significant impact. However, for more substantial improvements to take places, localized gains need to be scaled up either horizontally (other localities) or vertically (to higher levels). Given the advantages of working at the local level and the difficulty of working through mainstream bureaucratic agencies at higher levels in these countries, donors often prefer to create 'parallel-agencies' to reach out to larger numbers of beneficiaries. However, this may in the long run weaken the legitimacy of mainstream government institutions, and donor agencies may therefore choose to work as closely as possible with government officials from the beginning to build trust and demonstrating that new initiatives are non-threatening and help prepare the eventual mainstreaming of 'parallel agencies'.},

This report presents the results of an expert meeting to develop policy advice on urban planning, environment and health which was convened in the context of a larger project co-funded by DG Sanco (grant agreement 2006WH001, "Enhanced policy advice on environment and health in Europe"). This project included a work package on environmental health challenges in urban planning which had the objective to review - based on contributions from scientific experts and urban planners and practitioners - the impact and effectiveness of current regulatory frameworks and European Directives that affect urban planning and urban environmental conditions. The perspective of local authorities as the implementer of urban planning was used for the discussion and case studies on environmental health dimensions of urban planning were prepared by two cities. This meeting report provides (a) the summary notes of an expert meeting held in fall 2008, (b) an evidence review on the urban planning impacts on environment and health, and (c) summary reports of two case study cities on their local priority challenges. In conclusion, the challenges faced by local authorities in daily urban planning practice are highlighted and associated with the regulatory frameworks on international level. Various suggestions are being made to equip local authorities with better frameworks and resources to make urban settings healthier.},

  abstract = {The United Nations has adopted 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with 169 targets. International trade has substantial influences on global sustainability and human well-being. However, little is known about the impacts of international trade on progress towards achieving the SDG targets. Here we show that international trade positively affected global progress towards achieving nine environment-related SDG targets. International trade improved the SDG target scores of most (65\%) of the evaluated developed countries but reduced the SDG target scores of over 60\% of the evaluated developing countries. The SDG target scores of developed countries were higher than those of developing countries when trade was accounted for, but those scores would be lower than those of developing countries if trade were not a factor. Furthermore, trade between distant countries contributed more to achieving these global SDG targets than trade between adjacent countries. Compared with adjacent trade, distant trade was more beneficial for achieving SDG targets in developed countries, but it more negatively affected SDG target scores in developing countries. Our research suggests that enhancing the accounting for and management of virtual resources embedded in trade is essential for achieving and balancing sustainable development for all.},

Although studies have shown that regionally disaggregated model and model that distinguishes processing exports at the national level are necessary to estimate the embodied emissions in China's exports, no study evaluates this issue by simultaneously taking both regional and trade heterogeneity into account. To fill this gap, we re-estimate the CO2 emissions embodied in Chinaâ€™s exports at both regional and industrial level, by using the newly-developed inter-regional input-output (IRIOP) model that distinguishes processing trade from other trade at the regional level. Results show that compared to the IRIOP model, the traditional multi-regional input-output (MRIO) model has overestimated the environmental loss from exports by 14\%â€“25\% in 2002 and 7\%â€“20\% in 2012 for different regions. The largest bias is found in regions and industries with the highest processing export shares. Therefore, the IRIOP model gives more accurate accounting on the regional environmental loss due to national exports and thus is important for establishing effective emission mitigation policies.},

Such advances have also enabled the integration of multiple transportation modes and facilitated more predictable, environmentally-friendly, high-volume trips. While many of these technologies are now commonplace in higher income cities, they are less prevalent in lower income cities. This review identifies a) recent advances in technology and data that can facilitate multimodal urban travel, and b) the existing and potential application of these advances in low- and lower middle-income (LIC and LMIC) cities, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. This review examines peer-reviewed and grey literature and uses a multi-method approach with expert  interviews. The review identifies open transportation data and data standards, global positioning systems, cashless fare payment, and blockchain as having high potential to facilitate integrated mobility in lower income contexts, and considers potential barriers to adopting and risks of utilising these technologies in LICs and LMICs. The review finds that, enabled by technology and data advances, LICs and LMICs could leapfrog the high car use and inefficient urban freight systems typical of higher income cities to more integrated, efficient, multimodal transport systems},

  abstract = {The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) negotiations aspire to create the world's most ambitious trade agreement between the world's two largest economies. The politics associated with TTIP are different from those associated with previous trade negotiations. Moreover, they diverge from the prevailing International Political Economy (IPE) account of trade policy. The politics of TTIP diverge from the conventional IPE account of trade politics in two particularly noteworthy ways. First, rather than being rivals, American and European business interests are allies, adopting common positions on what they want the agreement to look like. Second, opposition within both the USA and the EU comes not primarily from firms and workers fearing increased economic competition, but from less traditional trade actors â€“ consumer and environmental groups and citizens â€“ concerned about the erosion of valued regulations. I argue that the unusual politics is the product of two distinct, but related factors. The first is the extraordinary level of cross-investment between the two economies. The second concerns the unique emphasis on addressing non-tariff barriers, particularly regulatory differences, and the significance of the negotiating partner. I test the plausibility of these arguments through within-case variation and by preliminary comparison to other contemporary negotiations of â€˜deepâ€™ preferential trade agreements.},

It concludes that the strategy is unlikely to address the identified problem, because it largely reflects continuity with past practices that did not prevent or resolve the politicization of trade policy. It also concludes that the Commissionâ€™s assessment of the politicization of trade policy is exaggerated. Thus, two wrongs may have produced the â€˜rightâ€™ policy, at least in the narrow sense that EU trade policy is unlikely to be as politically fraught in future.},

The number of criteria, currently sixteen, reflect a balance between ensuring that all key factors that foster pro-poor growth and poverty alleviation are captured, without overly burdening the evaluation process. Ratings for each of the criteria reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments. They focus on the quality of each country\&apos;s current policies and institutions - which are the main determinant of present aid effectiveness prospects. To fully underscore the importance of the CPIA in the IDA Performance Based Allocations, the overall country score is referred to as the IDA Resource Allocation Index (IRAI).},

  abstract = {We examine the current 'datafication' process underway in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), and the power shifts it is creating in the field of international development. The use of new communications and database technologies in LMICs is generating 'big data' (for example from the use of mobile phones, mobile-based financial services and the internet) which is collected and processed by corporations. When shared, these data are also becoming a potentially valuable resource for development research and policy. With these new sources of data, new power structures are emerging within the field of development. We identify two trends in particular, illustrating them with examples: first, the empowerment of public-private partnerships around datafication in LMICs and the consequently growing agency of corporations as development actors. Second, the way commercially generated big data is becoming the foundation for country-level 'data doubles', i.e. digital representations of social phenomena and/or territories that are created in parallel with, and sometimes in lieu of, national data and statistics. We explore the resulting shift from legibility (Scott, 1998) to visibility, and the implications of seeing development interventions as a byproduct of larger-scale processes of informational capitalism.},

The Financing for Development Summit in July 2015 presents a crucial opportunity to make the case for increased investments in development data, but to do so the statistical community need to agree upon a robust estimate of resource needs. Data for Development: A Needs Assessment for SDG Monitoring and Capacity Development,~prepared by a broad coalition of data for development experts convened by SDSN, attempts to respond to that challenge. â€œData for Development: A Needs Assessment for SDG Monitoring and Statistical Capacity Developmentâ€ estimates that the IDA-eligible countries will need to spend \$1 billion a year to upgrade their statistical systems and carry out regular data collection for the SDGs. Donors must maintain current contributions to statistics, of approximately US\$300 million per annum, and go further, leveraging US\$100-200 million more in Official Development Assistance (ODA) to support country efforts. For their part, recipient countries must commit to fill the gap, mobilizing domestic resources behind clear national strategies for the development of statistics (NSDSs). Both donors and recipient countries must look to join the data revolution. The unprecedented rate of innovation in data collection techniques and technologies and the capacity to distribute data widely and freely has expanded the horizon of possibility. The adoption of the SDGs presents a strategic opportunity to realize the data revolution and demonstrate the centrality of data for development.}

  urldate = {2020-07-27},
  abstract = {This commentary is an updated version of one originally published April 13, 2020. Confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) exceed 3 million as of April 30 and continue to climb. To combat the virusâ€™ spread, governments have implemented restrictions on economic activity unprecedented in peacetime. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development estimates that containment measures will cause an initial decline in the level of output of 20 to 25 percent in many economies, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects negative global growth for 2020 with â€œthe worst economic fallout since the Great Depression.â€ In response to this unprecedented shock, governments have pledged massive economic support, from direct payments to individuals to â€œlimitlessâ€ loans for struggling businesses. At a March 26 virtual summit, leaders of the Group of Twenty (G20) major economies said they were spending over \$5 trillion, equivalent to 7.4 percent of 2019 G20 countriesâ€™ gross domestic product (GDP), to â€œcounteract the social, economic, and financial impacts of the pandemic.â€ Since then, G20 governments have added to this figure as the extent of the economic fallout has become clearer. Developed by the CSIS iDeas Lab. Data updated through April 29, 2020 The CSIS Simon Chair analyzed and categorized major fiscal actions taken by G20 countries to respond to the economic shock. Several key trends emerge: Fiscal support has increased since April 10: As of April 29, we estimate that G20 countries are providing \$6.3 trillion in fiscal support, representing 9.3 percent of 2019 G20 GDP. Of the total, \$3.2 trillion will support direct government spending (4.8 percent of 2019 G20 GDP), up from \$2.1 trillion (3.1 percent of GDP) as of April 10. Credit enhancements contribute \$2.3 trillion and tax relief another \$0.8 trillion. G20 loan guarantee frameworks alone exceed \$2 trillion: G20 economies, led by European countries, have announced loan guarantee frameworks exceeding \$2 trillion, representing 3 percent of 2019 G20 GDP. Given that many guarantee frameworks do not quantify ex ante fiscal outlays, we assign a 50 percent â€œfiscal costâ€ to guarantee figures resulting in our headline fiscal support figure of \$6.3 trillion. Assigning a 100 percent â€œfiscal costâ€ to loan guarantees would boost our headline figure to \$7.4 trillion, or 10.8 percent of GDP. Conversely, assigning zero â€œfiscal costâ€ to loan guarantees would lower our headline figure to \$5.3 trillion, or 7.8 percent of GDP. Emerging market (EM) economies have boosted spending but still lag advanced economy (AE) peers by a wide margin: G20 EM fiscal support as of April 29 averages 3.2 percent of GDP, an increase of 1.2 percentage points since April 10 but still well below the average of 11.6 percent for AEs. Chinaâ€™s announcement of 2.3 trillion yuan (\$326 billion) in local government special purpose bond issuance brings its fiscal response to 3.7 percent of GDP, still well below the amount provided during the global financial crisis. Initial data updated through April 10 show the following trends: The largest component of fiscal support is intended to provide financing to businesses: As of April 10, 2020, we estimate G20 countries to have pledged \$5.3 trillion in fiscal support, representing 7.8 percent of 2019 G20 GDP. Of the total, \$2.5 trillion will support credit enhancements (3.7 percent of 2019 G20 GDP), compared to \$2.1 trillion (3.1 percent of GDP) in direct government spending and \$0.6 trillion (0.9 percent) in tax relief. (Our analysis does not include tax deferments.) Almost all support focuses on keeping companies and individuals afloat rather than stimulating new demand and investment, which will become the priority when health restrictions ease. Direct government spending is higher than levels during the global financial crisis (GFC), so far: The 3.1 percent of G20 2019 GDP in direct government spending compares to 2.5 percent of G20 GDP in 2008-2009 â€œcrisis-related discretionary measuresâ€ in response to the GFC. By the end of the pandemic, G20 countries will likely have spent far more than they did in the GFC as a percent of GDP. G20 countries have responded faster than during the GFC: In response to the pandemic, G20 governments announced nearly 8 percent of GDP in fiscal support between early February and early April, with more expected in the coming weeks and months. During the GFC, governmentsâ€™ responses were more protracted: in the United States, the epicenter of the GFC, the Economic Stimulus Act was signed into law in February 2008; the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, which included government funding for the purchase of troubled assets from financial institutions, was signed in October 2008; and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which authorized significant government spending, was signed in February 2009. Thus far, Chinaâ€™s fiscal response is more limited than during the GFC: Chinaâ€™s fiscal support as of April 10 amounts to roughly 1.3 percent of GDP, primarily through loans for impacted businesses and tax relief. This spending at the national level is far lower than the nearly 13 percent of GDP in fiscal spending (inclusive of local, provincial, and national spending) China announced in November 2008 in response to the GFC. Chinese officials have recently signaled they could provide additional stimulus later this year as the health situation stabilizes, but a desire to avoid adding to already high total debt levels will likely limit potential spending. EM economies are more constrained: As a percent of GDP, EM members of the G20 have announced far less fiscal support than AE G20 peers, reflecting, in part, more binding financing constraints. G20 EM fiscal support as of April 10 averages 2 percent of GDP versus 11.7 percent among G20 AEs. Many EMs are at an earlier stage of the pandemic relative to many AEs and may need international support to finance necessary relief measures. Notes: In addition to national efforts detailed above, the European Union has announced several responses: a 37 billion euro (\$40 billion) Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative and a 540 billion euro (\$586 billion) aid package to support member states. Both are not included in the \$6.3 trillion G20 total. Of the \$6.3 trillion of fiscal relief announced by G20 countries as of April 29, about \$45 billion was not itemized as credit enhancement, government spending, or tax relief. This analysis focuses on major, national, discretionary responses in G20 countries and thus does not reflect the full extent of support deployed by these countries in response to Covid-19, such as monetary and regulatory tools (rate cuts, repurchase operations, quantitative easing), automatic spending mechanisms, and additional support from subnational government. We include tax cuts and cancellations in tax relief but do not assign a monetary value to tax deferrals, where possible.

  abstract = {Three years into the 2030 Agenda it is already apparent that those living in fragile contexts are the furthest behind. Not all forms of fragility make it to the publicâ€™s eye: fragility is an intricate beast, sometimes exposed, often lurking underneath, but always holding progress back. Conflict, forced displacement, violent extremism, famine etc. are all causes and consequences of fragility. Hence the need to better understand, anticipate and respond to fragility. States of Fragility 2018 exposes the critical challenge posed by fragility in achieving the aspirations of the 2030 Agenda, sustainable development and peace. It highlights twelve key aspects of fragility, defying common assumptions and simplistic categorisation. It documents progress made in fragile situations on attaining sustainable development, unveiling exit doors from the fragility trap. It then illustrates the current state of financing to address fragility and suggests more effective approaches, accounting for its multidimensionality. Above all, the report aims to strike a balance between fragility's inherent complexity and the degree of simplicity that is required for efficient policy and decision making, namely through systems-based thinking; longer-term, consistent aid plans; the financing of peace; and a persistent focus on human beings.},

  abstract = {This 2015 OECD report on fragility contributes to the broader debate to define and implement post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It points out that addressing fragility in the new framework will be crucial if strides in reducing poverty are to be made. It argues in favour of proposed SDG 16 â€“ promoting peaceful and inclusive societies â€“ which aims to reduce violence of all forms. The 2015 report differs markedly from previous editions as it seeks to present a new understanding of fragility beyond fragile states. It assesses fragility as an issue of universal character that can affect all countries, not only those traditionally considered â€œfragileâ€ or conflict-affected. To do so, it takes three indicators related to targets of SDG 16 and two from the wider SDG framework: violence, access to justice, accountable and inclusive institutions, economic inclusion and stability, and capacities to prevent and adapt to social, economic and environmental shocks and disasters. It applies them to all countries worldwide, and identifies the 50 most vulnerable ones in all five dimensions. The group of countries most challenged on all five fronts differs little from the traditional list of fragile states and economies. Still, several middle-income countries with disproportionately high levels of crime-related violence, sub-national conflict or poor access to justice move into the spotlight. The report concludes that making headway on the targets will require building a new portfolio of tools and interventions, and an understanding of the role the international community should and can play in assisting this process.},

While there are many technical and methodological challenges inherent in improving~disaggregation, some of the largest barriers are political and financial. The Inclusive Data Charter (IDC) was developed by a task team of GPSDD partners to mobilize political commitments and meaningful actions to advance inclusive and disaggregated data.  The IDC advances the availability and use of inclusive and disaggregated data so that governments and organizations better understand, address, and monitor the needs of marginalized people and ensure no one is left behind. Launched in 2018, the IDC has quickly built momentum for inclusive data, garnered commitments from 20 diverse Champions, and supported them in accelerating and deepening progress.~ Inclusive Data Charter vision and principles~(AR,~EN, ES,~FR) Inclusive Data Charter FAQs (AR, EN, ES, FR) Inclusive Data Charter 2019 monitoring round Champions' Action Plans}

It finds that the growth in cross-border positions in relation to world GDP has come to a halt. This reflects much weaker capital flows to and from advanced economies, with diminished cross-border banking activity, and an increase in the weight of emerging economies in global GDP, as these economies have lower external assets and liabilities than advanced economies. Cross-border FDI positions have continued to expand, unlike positions in portfolio instruments and other investment. This expansion reflects primarily positions vis-Ã -vis financial centers, suggesting that the complexity of the corporate structure of large multinational corporations is playing an important role. The paper also explores the cross-country drivers of foreign ownership of domestic debt securities, highlighting in particular the role of the euro debt crisis in explaining its evolution.},

(2016) to quantify how changes in aggregate demand due to additional income from householdâ€™s remittances propagates through the network of input-output linkages in Sub-Saharan African countries. We first propose two network centrality measures to assess the role of some sectors as key input providers in the economy. Then, we use these measures to quantify the effect of sectoral linkages on sectoral and total output following an increase in remittances inflows. Our empirical results suggest that the effects of remittances on recipient economies increase with the degree of linkages across sectors, which is especially prominent in the case of the financial intermediation sector. Our paper contributes to the emerging macroeconomic literature on the propagation of shocks across sectors and the implications for the whole economy.},

While it is undeniable that remittances have poverty-alleviating and consumption-smoothing effects on recipient households, a key empirical question is whether they also serve to promote long-run economic growth. This study tackles this question and addresses the main shortcomings of previous empirical work, focusing on the appropriate measurement, and incorporating an instrument that is both correlated with remittances and would only be expected to affect growth through its effect on remittances. The results show that, at best, workers' remittances have no impact on economic growth.},

  abstract = {The role of trade in the global economy is at a critical juncture. Increased trade integration helped to drive economic growth in advanced and developing economies in the latter part of the 20th century. Since the early 2000\&rsquo;s, however, a slowdown in the pace of trade reform, a post-crisis uptick in protectionism, and risk of further reversals have been a drag on trade, productivity, and income growth. At the same time, trade is leaving too many individuals and communities behind, notably also in advanced economies. To be sure, job losses in certain sectors or regions in advanced economies have resulted to a large extent from technological changes rather than from trade. But adjustment to trade can bring a human and economic downside that is frequently concentrated, sometimes harsh, and has too often become prolonged. It need not be that way. With the right policies, countries can benefit from the great opportunities that trade brings and lift up those who have been left behind. Those polices ease adjustment to trade, as well as strengthen overall economic flexibility and performance.},

The chapter first describes how sustainability issues have been managed within EU external trade policy. The author recounts how the EU is striving to meet social and environmental challenges by focusing on the implementation of and compliance with the sustainability provisions of the EUâ€™s free trade agreements with international partners. Here, Zurek investigates both substantive and procedural aspects of the Trade and Sustainable Development (TSD) chapters and discusses the proposed reform on stronger implementation recently presented by the European Commission. Against the backdrop of an ongoing and growing discussion of the scope of the EUâ€™s authority and competence in external trade policy, Zurek considers two aspects of the European Court of Justiceâ€™s opinion on the Singapore agreement. First, the Court confirms that the TSD chapter falls under the EUâ€™s exclusive competence. Second, the Court confirms that a breach of the commitments concerning sustainable development in the free trade agreement should be regarded as a breach of the Vienna Convention and can thus be sanctioned.},
