# Abstract

Climate data is 


You are a climate policy analyst working for a non-governmental organization participating at the next round of negotiations at the next Conference of Parties. Your manager asks you to visualize the most recent data on GHG emissions and to create a two-page analytical that includes the following visualizations:

1. A map of CO~2~ emissions by country.
2. A map of GHG emissions (minus CO~2~) by country.
