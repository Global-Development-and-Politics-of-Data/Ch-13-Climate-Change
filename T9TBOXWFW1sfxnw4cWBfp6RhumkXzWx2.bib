  abstract = {"Nothing About Us Without Us!" (Latin: "Nihil de nobis, sine nobis") is a slogan used to communicate the idea that no policy should be decided by any representative without the full and direct participation of members of the group(s) affected by that policy. This involves national, ethnic, disability-based, or other groups that are often thought to be marginalized from political, social, and economic opportunities. The saying has its origins in Central European political traditions. It was the political motto that helped establishâ€”and, loosely translated into Latin, provided the name forâ€”Poland's 1505 constitutional legislation, Nihil novi, which first transferred governing authority from the monarch to the parliament. It subsequently became a byword for democratic norms. In this use, it is closely analogous to one of the most familiar slogans of the American Revolutionary War, 'No taxation without representation'. It is also a long-standing principle of Hungarian law and foreign policy, and was a cornerstone of the foreign policy of interwar Poland.The term in its English form came into use in disability activism during the 1990s. James Charlton relates that he first heard the term used in talks by South African disability activists Michael Masutha and William Rowland, who had in turn heard the phrase used by an unnamed East European activist at an earlier international disability rights conference. In 1998, Charlton used the saying as title for a book on disability rights. Disability rights activist David Werner used the same title for another book, also published in 1998.The saying has since moved from the disability rights movement to other interest group, identity politics, and populist movements.},

  abstract = {The manual attendance system is a time- consuming method which creates many difficulties for teachers to record student's attendance. Therefore, there is a need for a more convenient biometric student attendance system (SAS) to minimize these difficulties. As face recognition is considered among the best biometric technique, hence face recognition technique is inferential to be used in SAS. The main purpose of this study is to understand the existing works on SAS using face recognition. The current study conducted a survey on previous literature on student attendance system using face recognition. This paper describes the face recognition processes, approaches, and challenges involved in face recognition technique. Illumination in face recognition process has been a challenge in many previous studies. To address this challenge, this study proposed a mobile based SAS by using face recognition technique. The study comes up with a conclusion that face recognition is the most time saving method in SAS that used the mobile camera to resolve the issue of illumination and pose invariance for face recognition in SAS. It was also found that the use of hybrid approach of Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) algorithm, increases the accuracy of face recognition in SAS.},

This column uses a dynamic general equilibrium model calibrated to data from Uganda to characterise the macroeconomics of the pandemic and its aftermath in sub-Saharan Africa. It finds that the recovery depends significantly on how the public finances are restored to sustainability, and may be accelerated with external support.},

We find that laws that increase the cost of dispute resolution or employment protection substantially reduce registered sector employment and output, although the cost of industrial dispute regulation on output is larger. There is evidence of strong complementarities on labor laws: The output or employment costs of EPL are larger in states and periods where it is more difficult to resolve disputes, and not very important when such costs are low. Workers do not benefit from EPL or DL, as they do not increase the labor share or the wage bill, although EPL has a small positive effect on earnings per worker. Labor-intensive industries, such as textiles, are the hardest hit by amendments that increase employment protection while capital-intensive industries are the most affected by laws that increase the cost of labor dispute resolution.

We use the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) data from India and Pakistan, and Uwezo data from Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda that assess all children in a given age range, whether in school or not, on simple measures of learning in math, reading (local language), and English, to quantify how much achieving within country equality between the richest 20 percent and the poorest 40 percent in (a) grade attainment and (b) learning achievement by grade would contribute to an SDG-like global equity goal of universal numeracy and literacy for all children by age 12âˆ’13. We have three empirical findings. First, except in Kenya equalizing grade attainment between children from rich and poor households would lead to only modest progress in achieving universal numeracy, closing only between 8\% (India) and 25 \% (Pakistan) of the existing gap to universal literacy. Second, equalizing the learning profiles, that is, closing the gap in learning for children in the same grade between those from the poorest 40 percent of households and the richest 20 percent, would close between 16 \% (Pakistan and Uganda) and 34 \% (India) of the gap to universal numeracy, and between 13 \% (Uganda) and 44 \% (India) of the gap to universal literacy. Third, even with complete equality in grade attainment and learning achievement with children from the richest 20 percent children from poorer households still be far from the equity goal of universal numeracy and literacy, as even children from the richest 20 percent of households are far from universal mastery of basic reading and math by ages 12âˆ’13. In the currently low performing countries achieving universal literacy and numeracy to reach even a minimal proficiency of global equity goal will require more than just closing the rich-poor learning gap, it will take progress in learning for all.},

  abstract = {Today, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have been included in many researches to form smart environments. IoT is becoming increasingly integrated in our daily life at homes, streets, schools and everywhere. Using IoT based on WSNs in the educational filed is an important resource for better preparing students for the future digital world. Digital students attendance system in schools or universities is an example for case that technology can facilitate the traditional ways for checking students attendance instead of using the manual paper sheets which consume time and resources with higher probability of failure. In literature, there are many time attendance systems that proposed to enhance the manual traditional methods for taking and calculating students attendance in smart ways. In this paper, we proposed a user friendly students time attendance system that can be applicable in different schools or universities in order to form a smart classroom based on WSNs and IoT technologies. We proposed intelligent chairs that can be identified as the sources of information, which integrated with four 50 kg load sensors and HX711 amplifier that measure the students weights and send the digital signals to a receiver in order to recognize the student presence during class schedule. This smart classroom is also installed with one ZKTeco ZK4500 fingerprint reader in order to increase the identification for students. The transmitted signals from the intelligent chairs will be connected by Android application which will be installed on the lecturers' smart phones. So, teachers will get details and summary report of students attendance through the Android app. We implemented our proposed idea using java language, database and android system.},

The first two methods (dashboard and composite indices) are implemented using aggregate data from different sources ignoring the joint distribution of deprivations The other methods reflect the joint distribution and are implemented using data in which information on each dimension is available for each unit of analysis. After outlining each method, we provide a critical evaluation by discussing its advantages and disadvantages.},

The proposed indices are sensitive both to (i) the share of dimensions in which people are deprived and (ii) the duration of their multidimensional poverty experience. A related set of indices is proposed to measure transient poverty. An empirical illustration is provided for Chile between 1996 and 2006.},

  abstract = {The recently-adopted global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will have significant implications for national development planning in both developed and developing countries in the post-2015 period to 2030. Integrated, nationally-owned SDG strategies will be at the centre of national efforts to implement the new sustainable development agenda. The long-run processes and systems perspective that are inherent in the SDGs present complex analytical problems for policymakers and analysts. Scenario analysis and quantitative modelling will be important analytical tools to support national sustainable development planning, and there is an increasingly sophisticated suite of models available to decision makers. This paper reviews and assesses a broad range of different quantitative models that have the potential to support national development planning for the SDGs. The study develops a typology and inventory of 80 different models, and then reviews the comparative strengths, weaknesses and general utility of different models through an initial screening and subsequent multi-criteria analysis of short-listed models. Current gaps in model capabilities are highlighted in the context of providing analytical support for national development planning for the SDGs. While some existing models are particularly relevant, it is unlikely that an ideal model can analyse all SDG targets and variables of interest within a single modelling framework. Top-down â€˜macro frameworkâ€™ models are likely to be more useful for undertaking system-level or economy-wide scenario analysis driven by the national long-term goals and targets, and for exploring trade-offs and synergies among sectors. Bottom-up sectoral models will be able to support far more detailed option-level impact analysis of concrete interventions, technologies and investments. Combining both approaches within an analytical framework will provide a robust approach for analysis and decision-making. The results highlight a range of potential gaps in current modelling capabilities, and provide some new tools to assist with model selection.},

  abstract = {The top 1 percent income share has more than doubled in the United States over the last 30 years, drawing much public attention in recent years. While other English-speaking countries have also experienced sharp increases in the top 1 percent income share, many high-income countries such as Japan, France, or Germany have seen much less increase in top income shares. Hence, the explanation cannot rely solely on forces common to advanced countries, such as the impact of new technologies and globalization on the supply and demand for skills. Moreover, the explanations have to accommodate the falls in top income shares earlier in the twentieth century experienced in virtually all high-income countries. We highlight four main factors. The first is the impact of tax policy, which has varied over time and differs across countries. Top tax rates have moved in the opposite direction from top income shares. The effects of top rate cuts can operate in conjunction with other mechanisms. The second factor is a richer view of the labor market, where we contrast the standard supply-side model with one where pay is determined by bargaining and the reactions to top rate cuts may lead simply to a redistribution of surplus. Indeed, top rate cuts may lead managerial energies to be diverted to increasing their remuneration at the expense of enterprise growth and employment. The third factor is capital income. Overall, private wealth (relative to income) has followed a U-shaped path over time, particularly in Europe, where inherited wealth is, in Europe if not in the United States, making a return. The fourth, little investigated, element is the correlation between earned income and capital income, which has substantially increased in recent decades in the United States.},

The US decennial census was created to apportion seats in the House of Representatives among the states. The race classification derives from the provisions of the 1787 federal Constitution, which required that the census differentiate slave and free persons and exclude Indians not taxed for the purposes of Congressional apportionment. The current race and classification used by federal agencies is promulgated by the Office of Management and Budget as `Standards for Maintaining, Collecting, and Presenting Data on Race and Ethnicity'. The article traces the history of the categories, the development of methods for measuring census accuracy, particularly for measuring undercount, and the conceptualization of the differential undercount as a minority undercount. Finally it discusses potential implications of the recent changes in the classification to permit identification with more than one race category on the measurement of census accuracy.},

The recent global financial crisis, however, was accompanied by an exogenous upward spike in the international price of food, which led some countries to raise export barriers, thereby exacerbating both the price spike and the international welfare transfer associated with that change in the terms of trade. As in previous price-spike periods, that response by some food-exporting countries was accompanied by a lowering of import restrictions by numerous food-importing countries, further exacerbating the international price spike. This paper provides new evidence up to 2010 on the extent of the change in domestic relative to international prices in both groups of countries, and compares it with responses during two previous food price-spike periods. It concludes that there is a need for stronger World Trade Organization disciplines on export as well as import restrictions, so as to limit the extent to which beggar-thy-neighbour government responses to international price spikes (up or down) exacerbate those shocks.},

Community epidemiological surveys using the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview administered faceâ€toâ€face were carried out in 10 countries in North America (Canada and the US), Latin America (Brazil, Chile, and Mexico), Europe (Czech Republic, Germany, the Netherlands, and Turkey), and Asia (Japan). The total sample size was more than 37,000., Lifetime prevalence estimates of hierarchyâ€free DSMâ€IIIâ€R/DSMâ€IV MDE varied widely, from 3\% in Japan to 16.9\% in the US, with the majority in the range of 8\% to 12\%. The 12â€month/lifetime prevalence ratio was in the range 40\% to 55\%, the 30â€day/12â€month prevalence ratio in the range 45\% to 65\%, and median age of onset in the range 20 to 25 in most countries. Consistent socioâ€demographic correlates included being female and unmarried. Respondents in recent cohorts reported higher lifetime prevalence, but lower persistence than those in earlier cohorts. Major depressive episodes were found to be strongly coâ€morbid with, and temporally secondary to, anxiety disorders in all countries, with primary panic and generalized anxiety disorders the most powerful predictors of the first onset of secondary MDE., Major depressive episodes are a commonly occurring disorder that usually has a chronicâ€intermittent course. Effectiveness trials are needed to evaluate the impact of early detection and treatment on the course of MDE as well as to evaluate whether timely treatment of primary anxiety disorders would reduce the subsequent onset, persistence, and severity of secondary MDE.

  abstract = {Human capitalâ€”that is, resources associated with the knowledge and skills of individualsâ€”is a critical component of economic development1,2. Learning metrics that are comparable for countries globally are necessary to understand and track the formation of human capital. The increasing use of international achievement tests is an important step in this direction3. However, such tests are administered primarily in developed countries4, limiting our ability to analyse learning patterns in developing countries that may have the most to gain from the formation of human capital. Here we bridge this gap by constructing a globally comparable database of 164~countries from 2000 to 2017. The data represent 98\% of the global population and developing economies comprise two-thirds of the included countries. Using this dataset, we show that global progress in learningâ€”a priority Sustainable Development Goalâ€”has been limited, despite increasing enrolment in primary and secondary education. Using an accounting exercise that includes a direct measure of schooling quality, we estimate that the role of human capital in explaining income differences across countries ranges from a fifth to half; this result has an intermediate position in the wide range of estimates provided in earlier papers in the literature5â€“13. Moreover, we show that average estimates mask considerable heterogeneity associated with income grouping across countries and regions. This heterogeneity highlights the importance of including countries at various stages of economic development when analysing the role of human capital in economic development. Finally, we show that our database provides a measure of human capital that is more closely associated with economic growth than current measures that are included in the Penn world tables version 9.014 and the human development index of the United Nations15.},

  abstract = {Purpose The purpose of the paper is to examine the impact of infrastructure investment and development on economic growth in Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS) countries. The effect is examined for each country separately and also collectively by combining each country. Design/methodology/approach Ordinary least square regression method is applied to examine the effects of infrastructure investment and development on economic growth for each country. Panel data techniques such as panel least square method, panel least square fixed-effect model and panel least square random effect model are used to examine the collective impact by combining all countries in BRICS. The dynamic panel model is also incorporated for analysis in the study. Findings The results of the study are mixed. The association between infrastructure investment and development and economic growth for countries within BRICS is not robust. There is an insignificant relationship between infrastructure investment and development and economic growth in Brazil and South Africa. Energy and transportation infrastructure investment and development lead to economic growth in Russia. Telecommunication infrastructure investment and development and economic growth have a negative relationship in India, whereas there is a negative association between transport infrastructure investment and development and economic growth in China. Panel data results conclude that energy infrastructure investment and development lead to economic growth, whereas telecommunication infrastructure investment and development are significant and negatively linked with economic growth. Originality/value The study is novel as time series analysis and panel data analysis are used, taking the time span for 38 years (1980â€“2017) to investigate the influence of infrastructure investment and development on economic growth in BRICS Countries. Time-series regression analysis is used to test the impact for individual countries separately, whereas panel data regression analysis is used to examine the impact collectively for all countries in BRICS.},

Employing creative strategies to identify systematic biases in statistical outputs, these studies have shown that political manipulation of economic statistics does occur. But they have paid less attention to the question how official statistics are being manipulated. To shed light on the processes behind data manipulation, this article examines three recent high-profile cases in depth: Greeceâ€™s public deficit figures, controversies about Argentinaâ€™s inflation statistics, and the Brazilian â€œfiscal pedalingâ€ scandal. We make two main contributions: first, macroeconomic indicators are much more ambiguous than it is commonly realized. Therefore, the line between accurate and manipulated data is more blurry than typical narratives about manipulation acknowledge. Second, in recognition of this ambiguity we introduce a typology distinguishing four types of manipulation: outright manipulation (type 1), politically motivated guesstimating (type 2), the opportunistic use of methodology space (type 3), and indicators-management through indirect means (type 4). The findings from our cases highlight that the politics of statistics do not revolve around â€œrightâ€ and â€œwrongâ€ numbers. They are better understood as contestations about different shades of wrong.},

This paper employs the unexpected 1999 Brazilian exchange rate devaluation to identify the effects of exporting on Brazilian manufacturing firm-level wages using employerâ€“employee linked data. We find that this export shock increased the average wage gap between the high and low productivity firms. Most of this wage increase took the form of a larger wage premium, but increased sorting of workers also played a significant role. Further scrutiny at the occupationâ€“firm level indicates that the wage increases of managerial white-collar occupations came solely from wage premium variations. Skilled blue-collar workers also exhibited wage gains, but these gains came in equal shares from increased wage premium and worker sorting; the remaining occupational categories saw no wage increase.},

Co-designed with local partner organizations to be community-led and non-prescriptive, the program sought to encourage community participation to address local barriers in access to high quality care for pregnant women and infants. We evaluate the impact of this program through randomized controlled trials (RCTs), involving 100 treatment and 100 control communities in each country. We find that on average, this program did not have a statistically significant impact on the use or content of maternal and newborn health services, nor the sense of civic efficacy or civic participation among recent mothers in the communities who were offered it. These findings hold in both countries and in a set of prespecified subgroups. To identify reasons for the lack of impacts, we use a mixed-method approach combining interviews, observations, surveys, focus groups, and ethnographic studies that together provide an in-depth assessment of the complex causal paths linking participation in the program to improvements in MNH outcomes. Although participation in program meetings was substantial and sustained in most communities, and most attempted at least some of what they had planned, only a minority achieved tangible improvements and fewer still saw more than one such success. Our assessment is that the main explanation for the lack of impact is that few communities were able to traverse the complex causal paths from planning actions to accomplishing tangible improvements in their access to quality health care.},

Our wealth measure is unusually comprehensive, capturing not only reproducible and human capital but also natural capital, health improvements and technological change. We apply the framework to five countries: the United States, China, Brazil, India and Venezuela. We show that the often-neglected contributors to wealth â€“ technological change, natural capital and health capital â€“ fundamentally affect the conclusions one draws about whether given nations are achieving sustainability.

Despite this growing trend, there is neither an agreement upon a standard procedure nor a comprehensive assessment of existing measurement frameworks in the relevant literature. To tackle these challenges, this study (1) proposes an overarching eight-step procedure for composite indicator building and (2) develops a meta-level assessment framework to allow for a systematic review of existing disaster resilience measurement frameworks in application of composite indicator building. This meta-level framework was established on the basis of the proposed eight-step composite indicator building procedure and qualified with the introduction of 19 dimensions and 36 metrics for quality assessment. In order to select relevant disaster resilience measures for this analysis, the study applied a systematic survey to collect measures based on four inclusion criteria: community-based, multifaceted, quantitative, and operationalized. Accordingly, 17 resilience measurement frameworks were chosen for further analysis in this review. The results of the quality assessment demonstrated that, from the theoretical perspective, resilience assessments originate from either the socio-ecological or engineering fields and can be classified into two main types of resilience indices and tools. This differs from results of the methodological perspective, which indicate that resilience measures can be characterized as deductive or similar to hierarchical and inductive assessments.},

  abstract = {The measurement of community disaster resilience through the development of a comprehensive set of composite indicators is becoming increasingly commonplace. Despite this growing trend, there is neither an agreement upon a standard procedure nor a comprehensive assessment of existing measurement frameworks in the relevant literature. To tackle these challenges, this study (1) proposes an overarching eight-step procedure for composite indicator building and (2) develops a meta-level assessment framework to allow for a systematic review of existing disaster resilience measurement frameworks in application of composite indicator building. This meta-level framework was established on the basis of the proposed eight-step composite indicator building procedure and qualified with the introduction of 19 dimensions and 36 metrics for quality assessment. In order to select relevant disaster resilience measures for this analysis, the study applied a systematic survey to collect measures based on four inclusion criteria: community-based, multifaceted, quantitative, and operationalized. Accordingly, 17 resilience measurement frameworks were chosen for further analysis in this review. The results of the quality assessment demonstrated that, from the theoretical perspective, resilience assessments originate from either the socio-ecological or engineering fields and can be classified into two main types of resilience indices and tools. This differs from results of the methodological perspective, which indicate that resilience measures can be characterized as deductive or similar to hierarchical and inductive assessments.},

This paper presents three illustrative analysesonly possible with high-resolution data. First, it confirms that nighttime lights are highlysignificant proxies for population, employment, per-capita consumption, and electrification atvery local levels. However, elasticities between night lights and these variables are far lower intime series than in cross section, and vary widely across context and level of aggregation. Next,this study shows that the distribution of manufacturing employment across villages followsa power law: the majority of rural Indians have considerably less access to manufacturingemployment than is suggested by aggregate data. Third, a poverty mapping exercise exploreslocal heterogeneity in living standards and estimates the potential targeting improvement fromallocating programs at the village- rather than at the district-level. The SHRUG can serveas a model for open high-resolution data in developing countries.},

Food security measures are criticized for inaccurately characterizing food security at individual, household, and national scales, yet guidelines exist to prescribe a food security measure for a given situation. Some authors see the potential of a combination of indicators that apply at different scales rather than a single, universal food security measure. Limited literature exists on the relationship between food security and poverty, GDP, or crop yields. The relationship between food security and poverty is particularly challenging because neither term has a consistent definition, and the limited literature suggests a lack of consensus among experts. Little empirical research exists on the relationship between food security and GDP, though studies generally note an association between the two Studies that evaluate food security and crop yields provide limited evidence that the two are associated, though many studies use measures of crop yield as food security indicators and vice versa. More research is needed to establish whether there are preferred food security measurement tools for specific scales and situations, and to further explore the relationship between food security and poverty, GDP, and crop yields.},

Objective To investigate the effect of climate variability on childhood diarrhea (CDD) and identify high risk periods of diarrheal diseases. Methods The study was conducted in all districts located in three Zones (Awi, West and East Gojjam) of Amhara Region in northwestern parts of Ethiopia. Monthly CDD cases for 24 months (from July 2013 to June 2015) reported to each district health office from the routine surveillance system were used for the study. Temperature, rainfall and humidity data for each district were extracted from satellite precipitation estimates and global atmospheric reanalysis. The space-time permutation scan statistic was used to identify high risk periods of CDD. A negative binomial regression was used to investigate the relationship between cases of CDD and climate variables. Statistical analyses were conducted using SaTScan program and StataSE v. 12. Results The monthly average incidence rate of CDD was 11.4 per 1000 (95\%CI 10.8â€“12.0) with significant variation between males [12.5 per 1000 (95\%CI 11.9 to 13.2)] and females [10.2 per 1000 (95\%CI 9.6 to 10.8)]. The space-time permutation scan statistic identified the most likely high risk period of CDD between March and June 2014 located in Huletej Enese district of East Gojjam Zone. Monthly average temperature and monthly average rainfall were positively associated with the rate of CDD, whereas the relative humidity was negatively associated with the rate of CDD. Conclusions This study found that the most likely high risk period is in the beginning of the dry season. Climatic factors have an association with the occurrence of CDD. Therefore, CDD prevention and control strategy should consider local weather variations to improve programs on CDD.},

We first identify 908 unique estimates of the effects of FTAs on different trading pairs for the years 1986â€“2006. We then employ these estimates as our dependent variable in a â€œsecond stageâ€ analysis characterizing the heterogeneity in these effects. Interestingly, most of this heterogeneity (âˆ¼2/3) occurs within FTAs (rather than across different FTAs), with asymmetric effects within pairs (on exports vs. imports) also playing an important role. Our second stage analysis provides several intuitive explanations behind these variations. Even within the same agreement, FTA effects are weaker for more distant pairs and for pairs with otherwise high levels of ex ante trade frictions. The effects of new FTAs are similarly weaker for pairs with existing agreements already in place. In addition, we are able to relate asymmetries in FTA effects to each country's ability to influence the other's terms of trade. Out-of-sample predictions incorporating these insights enable us to predict direction-specific effects of future FTAs between any pair of countries. A simulation of the general equilibrium effects of TTIP demonstrates the significance of our methods.},

  abstract = {This article argues that it is necessary to unpack and appropriately separate the concepts of democracy and governance. The impetus for this research comes from the ongoing and expanding convolution of the concepts of democracy and governance by academics, international institutions and policymakers. One of the more important areas of research that is affected by this convolution argues that democracies guarantee the rule of law and provide superior institutions which considerably influence not only developing statesâ€™ overall development trajectories, but also multinational firmsâ€™ decisions on where to do business. I argue that these superior institutions, such as the rule of law and quality bureaucracy, are separate from the institutions of democracy and constitute the concept of governance infrastructure. Moreover, it is the institutions that comprise governance infrastructure and not the institutions of democracy that are key institutional determinants of developing statesâ€™ economic outcomes. Therefore, only by appropriately conceptualizing governance infrastructure, as is done in this article, and separating it theoretically and empirically from democracy will scholars and policymakers move forward in understanding the determinants of economic development.},

  abstract = {This article examines the evolving definition of transparency from a postmodernist approach. It traces the meaning of transparency from its use by nongovernmental and supranational organizations to its use in the international relations, nonprofit, public policy, and administration literature. It finds that the definition of transparency reveals three metaphors: transparency as a public value embraced by society to counter corruption, transparency synonymous with open decision-making by governments and nonprofits, and transparency as a complex tool of good governance in programs, policies, organizations, and nations. In the first metaphor, transparency is subtly intertwined with accountability. In the second, as transparency encourages openness, it increases concerns for secrecy and privacy. In the third, policymakers create transparency alongside accountability, efficiency, and effectiveness. The analysis concludes that these meanings affect the way organization members conduct and will conduct their day-to-day activities and how policies are and will be created. Transparency is becoming an unofficial mandate by the public and is often a legal mandate.},

But how actually does one live on less than \$1 per day?  This essay is about the economic lives of the extremely poor: the choices they face, the constraints they grapple with, and the challenges they meet.  A number of recent data sets and a body of new research allow us to start building an image of the way the extremely poor live their lives. Our discussion builds on household surveys conducted in 13 countries: Cote d'Ivoire, Guatemala, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Peru, South Africa, Tanzania, and Timor Leste (East Timor). These surveys provide detailed information on extremely poor households around the world, from Asia to Africa to Latin America, including information on what they consume, where they work, and how they save and borrow. We consider the extremely poor -- those living in households where the consumption per capita is less than \$1.08 per person per day -- as well as the merely "poor" -- defined as those who live under \$2.16 a day -- using 1993 purchasing power parity as benchmark. In keeping with convention, we call these the \$1 and \$2 dollar poverty lines, respectively.},

It employs sign restrictions to identify four external structural shocks â€“ demand, supply, monetary and commodity shocks, and relates their impact to countries' policy and structural framework. External shocks account for a small share of the variance of GDP, especially at short horizons. However, their relative contribution has risen in recent decades, as the incidence of domestic shocks has declined. Global monetary shocks have become the leading external source of GDP volatility in developing countries. At short horizons, real and financial openness raise the share of volatility attributable to external shocks. At longer horizons, financial openness helps reduce the volatility contribution of global real shocks, but not that of global monetary shocks, thus augmenting the relative role of the latter. Commodity-intensive countries exhibit higher vulnerability to all types of external shocks, not just commodity shocks.},

Despite initial control efforts, the outbreak quickly spread to neighboring zones and regions. The Oromiya Health Bureau required public health assistance to investigate the outbreak, determine potential causes, and assess the adequacy of the response, particularly given the concern that the number of cases being reported by health care personnel might represent only a fraction of what actually existed in the community.Methods: A physician-epidemiologistâ€“led team assessed the Guji, Bale, and East Shewa zones from September 15 to October 9, 2006. By using a purposive sample, we surveyed health bureau staff and cholera treatment center (CTC) staff and community members, assessed CTC sites, and interviewed key personnel of the various organizations responding to the outbreak.Results: The cholera cases mapped along the Ganale River. The individual attack rates were low (ranging from \textasciitilde{} 0.03\% to \textasciitilde{} 4.12\%), as was the overall attack rate for all 3 zones (almost 0.50\%). The individual CTC case fatality rates ranged from 0\% to 6.4\%, and the overall case fatality rate was 1.11\%. There was a trend toward men being disproportionately affected. This outbreak resulted primarily from poor sanitation and insufficient access to clean water. In Oromiya, the outbreak was addressed by a prompt and effective response, which included village chairmen at the community level. The use of community-based workers was successful and likely contributed significantly to control of the outbreak.Conclusion: Future epidemics will undoubtedly occur unless basic water and sanitation deficiencies are properly addressed. This outbreak prompts the need for increased local public health capacity to apply prevention strategies and establish ongoing surveillance.

The 'downsizing' and constriction of the concept within state policy, the de-funding of genuine empowerment strategies on the ground, and the substitution of microfinance and political quotas for empowerment are examined and analysed.},

To test this assumption, we collected data from 508 women working in women groups in Addis Ababa. Besides the economic dimension, five other dimensions of empowerment were studied (familial, legal, psychological, political and socioâ€cultural). Findings show that the relationships between these six dimensions of empowerment are weak and that the psychological dimension is most central. The economic dimension is hardly connected to other dimensions. Hence, a broad package of interventions seems needed to achieve empowerment in all respects.

It also has been mentioned in UN Sustainable Development Goals 6 to ensure that all people will have equal access to both water and sanitation service, as well as embedded in Goal 10 that aims to reduce inequality and promoting inclusiveness. However, the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme 2017 reported that 844 million people are still living without basic access to water, and 2.3 billion are still excluded from basic sanitation service. In this study, we present quantitative global-scale analysis of inequality of accessing the water and sanitation services from different wealth groups in 82 developing countries. We found that access inequality is rampant among developing countries particularly in terms of accessing basic sanitation service which the poor populations tend to be excluded in accessing the basic service. Based on combined multiple global data sets, we further identify which components of water governance are the key contributors to access inequality in water and sanitation services. We conclude that social and political dimension of water governance, such as government effectiveness, are influencing the occurrence of inequality of access to sanitation service in developing countries, while the inequality of access to basic water service was strongly influenced by the economic aspect of water governance, such as absorption of aid funds.},

Individuals who are vulnerable to the effects of extreme weather, namely the poor, the elderly/disabled, children, prisoners, and substance abusers have experienced heightened levels of mental, emotional, and bodily stress due to natural disaster exposure. Researchers from a variety of disciplines, public health, social science, and environmental studies, in particular, are examining how natural disasters are impacting mental and physical health functioning while noting the demographic factors leaving certain groups more susceptible to harm. A systematic literature review was conducted on the past 12 years of research that examined natural disaster-related experiences and psychological and physiological health outcomes on populations who are more vulnerable to adverse weather impacts. It was found that the mental and physical health of marginalized populations during and after a natural disaster were elevated and/or exacerbated by circumstances pertaining to the weather event and the lack of disaster-response actions. It was also found that fostering social capital is a way to combat stressors in disadvantaged communities. It is imperative that clinicians and policy makers confront the issue of climate change and natural disasters, developing relief efforts and preventative measures to secure the well-being of underserved groups who may not have many resources at their disposal.},

Yet, climate change impacts will not be contained within country borders, meaning that climate change adaptation governance should also consider â€œborderless climate risksâ€ that cascade through the international system, in relatively simple or highly complex ways. In this paper, we demonstrate how the notion of borderless climate risks challenges the dominant territorial framing of adaptation and its problem structure. To advance knowledge, we ask: why has a territorial framing and the national and sub-national scales dominated adaptation governance? How do borderless climate risks challenge this framing and what are possible governance responses? We draw on constructivist international relations theory and propose that the epistemic community that developed to interpret climate change adaptation for decision-makers had certain features (e.g. strong environmental sciences foundation, reliance on place-based case study research) that established and subsequently reinforced the territorial framing. This framing was then reinforced by an international norm that adaptation was primarily a national or local responsibility, which has paradoxically also informed calls for international responsibility for funding adaptation. We conclude by identifying types of governance responses at three different scalesâ€”national and bilateral; transnational; international and regionalâ€”and invite more systematic evaluation by the IR community.},

To resolve this paradox, one has to recognize that many economists accept the criticism of the GDP indicator but deny its relevance. This paper evaluates the reasons for denial. This entails five steps: (1) a brief review is offered of the extensive literature showing that GDP per capita (growth) is far from a robust indicator of social welfare (progress); (2) the influence of GDP information on economic decisions by firms, consumers, investors and governments is examined; (3) behavioural explanations for a widespread belief in the relevance of GDP are discussed; (4) the customary arguments in favour of the GDP indicator are analysed; and (5) proposed alternatives to GDP are evaluated. The paper ends with outlining the implications of giving less attention to GDP information in policy and politics. It is argued that removal of the information failure which GDP represents, in monitoring economic progress and guiding public policy, will lead to decisions and developments being more in line with improving human well-being. Moreover, ignoring GDP information is consistent with a perfectly neutral stance regarding economic (GDP) growth. Indeed, an unconditional anti- or pro-growth imperative acts as an unnecessary constraint on our search for human progress.},

  abstract = {Cholera is an acute, diarrheal infection of the intestine which spreads by the ingestion of contaminated water or food. It is an important health problem, especially in counties with poor sanitation and hygiene. In this paper, the Cholera dynamics model with continuous controls is theoretically investigated using optimal control theory. First, the parameters of the assumed model are estimated using a real data of Cholera from Ethiopiaâ€™s Oromia Region. Then the sensitivity analyses of the parameters of the deterministic Cholera model is investigated to see the relative importance of parameters. It is observed that the intake rate of Vibrio Cholerae from infected humans (Î²2) and the cholera recovery rate (Î³) are the most sensitive parameters. The system is then extended into an optimal control problem to investigate how treatment and sanitation should be carried out to reduce the number of infected and pathogenic populations while minimizing the total cost of implementation. To this end, we have designed a control functional having two controls: treatment and sanitation. Next, we have shown that the optimal controls exist for the system. Then the optimal controls are represented in terms of the solutions of the optimality system, and then the uniqueness of the optimality system is proved. The average cost-effectiveness ratio and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio are used and compared to examine the most cost-effective strategy. The use of treatment as control is found out to be the most cost-effective strategy using both methods.},

  abstract = {This report provides new evidence on the increasing dispersion in wages and productivity using novel micro-aggregated firm-level data from 16 countries. First, the report documents an increase in wage and productivity dispersions, for both manufacturing and market services. Second, it shows that these trends are driven by differences within rather than across sectors, and that the increase in dispersion is mainly driven by the bottom of the distribution, while divergence at the top occurs only in the service sector, and only after 2005. Third, it suggests that between-firm wage dispersion is linked to increasing differences between high and low productivity firms. Fourth, it suggests that both globalisation and digitalisation imply higher wage divergence, but strengthen the link between productivity and wage dispersion. Finally, it investigates the impact of minimum wage, employment protection legislation, trade union density, and coordination in wage setting on wage dispersion and its link to productivity dispersion.},

Yet persistent challenges have prevented substantive developments in tracking adaptation and the assessment of adaptation actions and their outcomes. Here, we provide an overview of the challenges of adaptation tracking and propose a comprehensive conceptual framework for assessing adaptation progress by governments that is scalable over time and across contexts. The framework addresses the core components of adaptation assessment (vulnerability, goals and targets, adaptation efforts, and adaptation results) and characterizes subcomponents focused on adaptation effort (leadership, organizations and policy). In particular, we highlight how critical insights can be uncovered by systematically tracking policy efforts over time, and discusses novel approaches to data collection. The Paris Agreement places new emphasis on the need to take stock of adaptation progress. This Perspective discusses the conceptual and methodological challenges associated with monitoring adaptation and provides a comprehensive framework for tracking progress among governments.},

Citiesâ€™ economic efficiency requires, therefore, avoiding any spatial fragmentation of labor markets. In simpler terms, it means that all the locations where jobs are offered should, at least potentially, be physically accessible from all householdsâ€™ place of residence within about an hourâ€™s travel time. This requirement should be born in mind when evaluating alternative urban shapes. Any type of spatial organization implying that homes and jobs should be matched individuallyâ€”i.e., that workers need to have good access only to their current job locationâ€”contradicts our premise that large competitive labor markets are efficient and that this efficiency alone justifies the complexity and high operating costs of large cities.},

In this article, we explore how the politics of performance review played out in public sustainable development reporting at the global-national nexus. By examining the case of Swedish reporting to the United Nations High Level Political Forum in 2017, we find policy translation, accountability preparation and identity formation to be key functions of SDG reporting. We draw attention to the performative and political features of these functions in the sustainable development realm. With a fast approaching deadline, policy translation of global indicators to the national context glossed over politically contentious issues. Reporting served to enable peer review among governments rather than hierarchical accountability of domestic politics. Moreover, the identity formation function of SDG reporting was strong on the international stage while domestically it was challenged by broader political struggles. In conclusion, our study bears witness of the formative power of public reporting for SDG governance. We call for comparative research to allow for further theory-building on the politics of public reporting on sustainable development.},

Recently, the number of comparative adaptation policy cases has increased, focusing on examining, describing, and/or explaining how countries, regions, and vulnerable groups are adapting across a larger sample of contexts and over time. There are, however, critical empirical, conceptual and methodological choices and challenges for comparative adaptation research. This article systematically captures and assesses the current state of largerâ€n (n â‰¥ 20 cases) comparative adaptation policy literature. We systematically analyze 72 peerâ€reviewed articles to identify the key choices and challenges authors face when conducting their research. We find among others that almost all studies use nonprobability sampling methods, few existing comparative adaptation datasets exist, most studies use easy accessible data which might not be most appropriate for the research question, many struggle to disentangle rhetoric from reality in adaptation, and very few studies engage in critical reflection of their conceptual, data and methodological choices and the implications for their findings. We conclude that efforts to increase data availability and use of more rigorous methodologies are necessary to advance comparative adaptation research. This article is categorized under:},

Insofar as governments have finite resources and make trade-offs in public goods investments, a GPI that precisely targets the provision of a particular public good may cause governments to substitute away from the provision of other, related, public goods. We argue that both the main effect of the GPI (on the measured public good) and this substitution effect vary systematically based on the domestic political institutions and informational environments of targeted states. Specifically, we contend that both the main and substitution effects of GPIs should be largest for governments that are least accountable (opaque and nondemocratic) and should be smallest for those that are most accountable. We illustrate the logic of these arguments using a formal model and test these claims using data on primary and secondary enrollment rates across 114 countries. We find that countries substitute toward primary education enrollment rates (which is targeted by the Millennium Development Goals) and away from secondary (which is not), and that these effects are mitigated as accountability rises.},

We argue that both the main effect of the GPI (on the measured public good) and this substitution effect vary systematically based on the domestic political institutions and informational environments of targeted states. Specifically, we contend that both the main and substitution effects of GPIs should be largest for governments that are least accountable (opaque and non-democratic) and should be smallest for those that are most accountable. We illustrate the logic of these arguments using a formal model and test these claims using data on primary and secondary enrollment rates across 114 countries. We find that countries substitute toward primary (which is targeted by the Millennium Development Goals) and away from secondary (which is not), and that these effects are mitigated as accountability rises.},

All variables are found stationary at first differencing both at constant and constant plus trend level under the ADF and PP stationary tests. The Johansen-Juselius procedure is applied to test the cointegrating relation between variables followed by a vector error correction model. The empirical results trace a strong long-run equilibrium relationship between GDP growth rates and the explanatory variables with unidirectional casual flows. The volume of FDI and level of capital formation are found to have significant positive effect on changes in real GDP. The degree of trade openness unleashes negative but diminishing influence on GDP growth rates. We conclude that Bangladesh should formulate FDI-led polices and ensure higher degree of capital formation to enhance her economic growth rates at large.},

We can and should build a better globalization that addresses enduring inequality, based on a radical analysis cognizant of the partiality, fragility and incompleteness of the existing global governance architecture, and which seeks to expand, upgrade and democratize the multilateral order. Second, following a postfinancial crisis interregnum replete with morbid symptoms, the Covid-19 shock potentially represents the dÃ©nouement of a long period of neoliberal decay, after which different approaches to globalization will be necessary. Finally, only a reformed G20 can provide the crucial coordinating function that any process of progressive reglobalization requires, with three necessary reforms: its proper institutionalization with a permanent Secretariat; a widening of its remit to cover all aspects of contemporary globalization; and a concomitant narrowing of its focus to discharge aggressively that specific coordinating function.},

Existing research focuses on the effects of Western development projects on inter-personal inequality and inequality across different subnational regions. However, China has recently become a major financier of economic infrastructure in Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, and Central and Eastern Europe, and it is unclear if these investments diffuse or concentrate economic activity. We introduce an original dataset of geo-located Chinese Governmentfinanced projects in 138 countries between 2000 and 2014, and analyze the effects of these projects on the spatial distribution of economic activity within host countries. We find that Chinese development projects in general, and Chinese transportation projects in particular, reduce economic inequality within and between subnational localities. Our results suggest that Chinese investments in â€œconnective infrastructureâ€ produce positive economic spillovers that lead to a more equal distribution of economic activity in the localities where they are implemented.},

  abstract = {Why the news about the global decline of infectious diseases is not all good. Plagues and parasites have played a central role in world affairs, shaping the evolution of the modern state, the growth of cities, and the disparate fortunes of national economies. This book tells that story, but it is not about the resurgence of pestilence. It is the story of its decline. For the first time in recorded history, virus, bacteria, and other infectious diseases are not the leading cause of death or disability in any region of the world. People are living longer, and fewer mothers are giving birth to many children in the hopes that some might survive. And yet, the news is not all good. Recent reductions in infectious disease have not been accompanied by the same improvements in income, job opportunities, and governance that occurred with these changes in wealthier countries decades ago. There have also been unintended consequences. In this book, Thomas Bollyky explores the paradox in our fight against infectious disease: the world is getting healthier in ways that should make us worry. Bollyky interweaves a grand historical narrative about the rise and fall of plagues in human societies with contemporary case studies of the consequences. Bollyky visits Dhaka--one of the most densely populated places on the planet--to show how low-cost health tools helped enable the phenomenon of poor world megacities. He visits China and Kenya to illustrate how dramatic declines in plagues have affected national economies. Bollyky traces the role of infectious disease in the migrations from Ireland before the potato famine and to Europe from Africa and elsewhere today. Historic health achievements are remaking a world that is both worrisome and full of opportunities. Whether the peril or promise of that progress prevails, Bollyky explains, depends on what we do next. A Council on Foreign Relations Book},

The 2019 United Nations World Water Development Report provided a dramatic status of world water, however without questioning the main drivers of an imminent water crisis, that were unbounded, unequal, economic, and population growth, within the context of reducing resources in a finite world. Despite the report was a small step forward in awareness, still, it was not proposing satisfactory remedies. With business-as-usual, without acting on the drivers of water scarcity, regional water crises were inevitable in the next 3 decades, starting from Africa. Constrained by political, financial, and energy burdens, the technological improvements that have helped humanity to deal with the increased demand for water, food, and energy over the last 70 years, were likely not enough to avoid the water crisis. On top of forecast is the Covid19 pandemic. Coronavirus cases are (August 4, 2020) 18,446,065 and fatalities are 697,202 worldwide, and still growing. The containment measures enforced for Covid19 infection following the examples in the United Kingdom have already produced significant damage to the world economy. This will limit social expenditures in general, and the expenditures for the water issue in particular. The water crisis will consequently become worse in the next months, with consequences still difficult to predict. This will be true especially for Africa, where the main problem has always been poverty. There is the opportunity of significant health, food, and water crisis, especially in Africa. While the concepts of washing hands and social distancing that are difficult to apply havenâ€™t produce so far major issues with the Covid19 outbreak in Africa, borders closure, restrictions on movement, and more poverty will translate in a lack of food and water potentially much more worrying than the virus spreading.},

I argue that a key dilemma for intersectionality researchers is that the additive (e.g., Black + Lesbian + Woman) versus intersectional (e.g., Black Lesbian Woman) assumption inherent in measurement and qualitative and quantitative data analyses contradicts the central tenet of intersectionality: social identities and inequality are interdependent for groups such as Black lesbians, not mutually exclusive. In light of this, interpretation becomes one of the most substantial tools in the intersectionality researcherâ€™s methodological toolbox.},

  abstract = {The Green Climate Fund (GCF) is a significant and potentially innovative addition to UNFCCC frameworks for mobilizing increased finance for climate change mitigation and adaptation. Yet the GCF faces challenges of operationalization not only as a relatively new international fund but also as a result of US President Trumpâ€™s announcement that the United States would withdraw from the Paris Agreement. Consequently the GCF faces a major reduction in actual funding contributions and also governance challenges at the levels of its Board and the UNFCCC Conference of the Parties (COP), to which it is ultimately accountable. This article analyzes these challenges with reference to the GCFâ€™s internal regulations and its agreements with third parties to demonstrate how exploiting design features of the GCF could strengthen its resilience in the face of such challenges. These features include linkages with UNFCCC constituted bodies, particularly the Technology Mechanism, and enhanced engagement with non-Party stakeholders, especially through its Private Sector Facility. The article posits that deepening GCF interlinkages would increase both the coherence of climate finance governance and the GCFâ€™s ability to contribute to ambitious climate action in uncertain times.Key policy insights The Trump Administrationâ€™s purported withdrawal from the Paris Agreement creates challenges for the GCF operating model in three key domains: capitalization, governance and guidance.Two emerging innovations could prove crucial in GCF resilience to fulfil its role in Paris Agreement implementation: (1) interlinkages with other UNFCCC bodies, especially the Technology Mechanism; and (2) engagement with non-Party stakeholders, especially private sector actors such as large US investors and financiers.There is also an emerging soft role for the GCF as interlocutor between policy-makers and non-Party actors to help bridge the communication divide that often plagues cross-sectoral interactions.This role could develop through: (a) the GCF tripartite interface between the Private Sector Facility, Accredited Entities and National Designated Authorities; and (b) strengthened collaborations between the UNFCCC Technical and Financial Mechanisms.},

Powerful countries, corporations and banks have favoured a deepening of neoliberal environmental governance, while civil society actors have argued over retaining movement concepts, won small representational victories, while participating in a process that has subjected them to a deepened practise of advanced liberal governance. The process has thus far produced 'non-outcomes' that fail to meet hopes that the GCF could provide a significant scaling up and paradigm shift in global climate finance. However, civil society engagement appears to be, somewhat inadvertently, exposing the 'overflows', limits and contradictions inherent in advanced liberal governance. The impasse created has prompted alternative governmentalities to emerge, not least of spectacle and (non-)performativity, which may be generating an anti-politics in environmental governance.},

It focuses on initiatives by UN Women, including the Progress of the Worldâ€™s Women 2015â€“16. Our analysis of the data compiled by UN Women raises questions about what might account for the over-representation of women among the poor in official accounts of poverty, and how this is plausibly changing (or not) over time. The paper highlights that analysis of what is measured and how needs to be understood in relation to who is the focus of measurement. The lack of available data which is fit for purpose questions the extent to which gender poverty differences are â€˜realâ€™ or statistical. There is a continued reliance on comparing female with male headed households, and we argue the move by UN Women to adopt the notion of Female Only Households reflects available data driving conceptual understandings of womenâ€™s poverty, rather than conceptual advances driving the search for better data. Wider UN processes highlight that while sensitivity to differences among women and their subjectivities are paramount in understanding the multiple processes accounting for gender bias in poverty burdens, they are still accorded little priority. To monitor advances in Agenda 2030 will require more and better statistics. Our review suggests that we are still far from having a set of tools able to adequately measure and monitor gendered poverty.},

A rise in the numbers of women to men living in income-poor households has occurred despite feminized anti-poverty programs, most notably conditional cash transfers (CCTs), which target resources to women. This paper shows that methodological differences in what, how, and who is the focus of measurement may influence patterns of poverty â€œfeminization.â€ It also suggests that feminized policy interventions might in themselves be playing a role in the re-feminization of poverty, not least because of data and definitional limitations in the way female-headed households and, relatedly, womenâ€™s poverty are understood. The somewhat paradoxical interactions between the feminization of household headship, the feminization of poverty, and the feminization of anti-poverty programs present interesting challenges for redressing gender gaps in poverty within the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTIONThis chapter considers the conceptualization and measurement of politically relevant group-based social identities such as ethnic identity that have figured prominently in motivating and shaping political action. Although we mention some of the substantive findings that can be established using these measures, our primary concern is with different ways to measure and understand ethnic identity â€“ the use of history, demography, surveys, primary source materials, content analysis, and discourse analysis. We argue that a combination of these methods must be used to fully comprehend the political role of ethnicity at the mass public or elite level.Ethnicity is an intersubjectively agreed-upon categorization of individuals that is widely and publicly understood to have meaning within a society. Consequently, social scientists often use ethnic categories to interpret and explain facts and events. For example, historians and demographers construct narratives or present data using ethnic categories, and survey researchers ask people about their ethnic identity (e.g., African American, Estonian, Tatar) to determine its prevalence and correlates in a society. Because ethnic identity also motivates human activity and matters for people's lives â€“ especially their political activity â€“ even more can be learned by asking people about these activities (or by observing them directly) as well as by asking them about their identity directly. Moreover, because ethnic identity is constructed through social and psychological processes of categorization (there is no primordial periodic table of social identities), much can be learned about it by studying cultural and social processes, such as the course of political arguments, debates in cultural journals, discussions in the mass media, and social movements that frame, evoke, and memorialize ethnic identities.},

Instead of measuring gender inequality in outcomes, the SIGI and its subindices measure long-lasting social institutions defined as societal practices and legal norms that frame gender roles. The SIGI combines them into a multidimensional index of women's deprivation caused by gendered social institutions. Inspired by the Fosterâ€“Greerâ€“Thorbecke poverty measures, the SIGI offers a new way of aggregating gender inequality by penalizing high inequality in each dimension and allowing only partial compensation between subindices. The indices identify countries and dimensions of gendered social institutions that deserve attention. Empirical results confirm that the SIGI complements other gender-related indices.},

While there is a diplomatic history leading to this arrangement, we argue the GCF's allocation strategy requires further refinement if it is to adequately address climate change. We advocate prioritizing climate mitigation over adaptation in funding while not ignoring climate justice concerns all together. We recommend a more targeted approach to its funding allocations based upon the GHGs abatement potential for mitigation or climate vulnerability for adaptation of very specific non-Annex I countries. We believe these refinements will help to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of scarce climate change financing resources required to achieve the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) central objective of no more than 1.5 Â°C by 2100, which requires emissions reductions between 70 and 95\% (2010 levels) by 2050.},

Capitalism, economic development, nation and nation-state are interdependent historical concepts. Capitalist development depends on a national strategy that relies on a nation capable of formulating it. Old developmentalism was an effective strategy in promoting growth in Latin America since the 1930s, but in the 1980s got distorted and surpassed by the facts. Differently from it, new developmentalism is export oriented, rejecting protectionism. Since it wants a strong market and a strong state, it supports fiscal discipline aiming at positive public savings. It is nationalist, because it is oriented to the national interest, and rejects pressures from the North, but it is a liberal, social and republican nationalism. It differs strongly, however, from conventional orthodoxy because rejects the growth strategy with foreign savings and the opening of capital accounts, says that the exchange rate can and should be administered, and believes that in Brazil a special strategy is required to overcome the high interest rate/appreciated currency which maintains the Brazilian economy unstable.},

  abstract = {Objectives Food and water insecurity have both been demonstrated as acute and chronic stressors and undermine human health and development. A basic untested proposition is that they chronically coexist, and that household water insecurity is a fundamental driver of household food insecurity. Methods We provide a preliminary assessment of their association using cross-sectional data from 27 sites with highly diverse forms of water insecurity in 21 low- and middle-income countries across Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and the Americas (N = 6691 households). Household food insecurity and its subdomains (food quantity, food quality, and anxiety around food) were estimated using the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale; water insecurity and subdomains (quantity, quality, and opportunity costs) were estimated based on similar self-reported data. Results In multilevel generalized linear mixed-effect modeling (GLMM), composite water insecurity scores were associated with higher scores for all subdomains of food insecurity. Rural households were better buffered against water insecurity effects on food quantity and urban ones for food quality. Similarly, higher scores for all subdomains of water insecurity were associated with greater household food insecurity. Conclusions Considering the diversity of sites included in the modeling, the patterning supports a basic theory: household water insecurity chronically coexists with household food insecurity. Water insecurity is a more plausible driver of food insecurity than the converse. These findings directly challenge development practices in which household food security interventions are often enacted discretely from water security ones.},

Within countries, aid disproportionately flows to regions with more of the richest people. Aid does not favor regions with more of the poorest people. These findings violate the stated preferences of the multilateral donors under study, suggesting that the donors either cannot or are not willing to exercise control over the location of aid projects within countries. The results also suggest that aid is not being allocated effectively to alleviate extreme poverty.},

  abstract = {This is the first paper in the new IIED Climate Change Working Paper series. As adaptation to climate change becomes the focus of increasing attention and the target of significant spending, there is a growing need for frameworks and tools that enable organisations to track and assess the outcomes of adaptation interventions. This paper presents a coherent framework for climate change adaptation programming, including potential indicators, or indicator categories/types, for tracking and evaluating the success of adaptation support and adaptation interventions. The paper begins with a discussion of some of the key issues related to the evaluation of adaptation, and outlines some of the main difficulties and constraints with respect to the development of adaptation indicators. Next, an evaluation framework is proposed and indicator categories or 'domains' are identified. Lastly, key conclusions are provided and a theory of change is outlined that shows how development and use of the framework could lead to more effective adaptation investments for climate resilient development.},

  abstract = {Background: The Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP) Monitoring and Accountability Framework includes an indicator to reach 90\% national vaccination coverage and 80\% vaccination coverage in every district or equivalent administrative unit with three doses of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis containing vaccines (DTP) across all 194 country signatories to GVAP by 2020. Assessment of progress against the district indicator component requires GVAP defined "valid" coverage. GVAP defines district coverage "valid" if the WHO and UNICEF estimate of national immunization coverage for DTP3 in the most recent year is 1) â‰¥90\%, or 2) is identical to the reported national administrative coverage for DTP3 (regardless of coverage level). We draw attention to the potential disconnect that currently exists between GVAP vaccination coverage indicators and the practical capacity to monitor progress against those indicators. Methods: We obtained national and aggregated district coverage data for the third dose of DTP containing vaccine (DTP3) for 194 countries for 2016 from publicly available databases maintained by the World Health Organization (WHO). We reviewed district line lists of coverage data for 96 countries for which district line lists of DTP3 coverage were available and categorized the district coverage values using the same groupings used by the GVAP Monitoring Framework. In doing so, we also tracked the number of districts with reported coverage {$>$}100\%. Results: In 2016, at least one district with DTP3 coverage value {$>$}100\% was reported in the line lists of 76 of the 96 countries. Agreement in district coverage categories across each of five coverage groupings ({$<$}50\%, 50-79\%, 80-89\%, 90-94\%, â‰¥95\%) was observed in 43 of the 96 countries. In 2016, 46 of 194 countries were classified as achieving both national DTP3 coverage â‰¥90\% and DTP3 coverage â‰¥80\% in every district, thereby achieving the GVAP target. Among these 46 countries, 22 countries reported district line-listing coverage data. We identified 10 of the 22 countries that reported at least one district with DTP3 coverage {$>$}100\% ranging from 8\% of districts in Sri Lanka to 97\% of districts in Bangladesh. Seven countries reported at least 25\% of the total districts had DTP3 coverage {$>$}100\%. Conclusions: The observations of disparate district coverage from a subset of countries reporting district line lists of coverage data are a concern for the current GVAP approach ascribing the achievement of "valid" district coverage data. Our review of district line lists of coverage data does not support a current GVAP assumption that the district coverage values â‰¥80\% fall between 80\% and 100\% (inclusive). We hope these results spur a review of the current approach to assess the GVAP coverage target of â‰¥90\% national DTP3 coverage and â‰¥80\% DTP3 coverage in all districts.},

Using a panel time series approach and a large cross-country dataset, the paper estimates a long-run aggregate production function relating gross domestic product to human capital, physical capital, and a synthetic measure of infrastructure comprising transport, power and telecommunications. Tests of the cointegration rank allowing it to vary across countries reveal a common rank with a single cointegrating vector, which we interpret as the long-run production function. Estimation of its parameters is performed using the pooled mean group (PMG) estimator, which allows for unrestricted short-run parameter heterogeneity across countries while imposing the (testable) restriction of long-run parameter homogeneity. The long-run elasticity of output with respect to the synthetic infrastructure index ranges between 0.07 and 0.10. The estimates are highly significant, both statistically and economically, and robust to alternative dynamic specifications and infrastructure measures. Tests of parameter homogeneity fail to yield evidence that the long-run parameters differ across countries. Copyright Â© 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

This report focuses on the experiences of three key donors: the United States (US), the United Kingdom (UK) and Germany. It also provides case studies showing the operationalisation of the agenda in three fragile states, namely, Afghanistan, Cambodia and Nepal. Because the FS agenda is relatively new, the policies, tools, and institutions to implement it are still being developed. To date, implementation efforts have remained largely uncoordinated and incomplete. Bringing coherence and â€˜joined-upâ€™ approaches to the operationalisation of fragile states programming is therefore a priority for the wide variety of actors involved.},

Using instrumental variables estimation, we demonstrate that this aid has positive effects on human rights and democracy, although the effects are short-lived after the shock to aid dissipates. We adduce the timing of events, qualitative evidence, and theoretical insights to argue that the conditionality associated with an increased aid commitment is responsible for the positive effects in the domains of human rights and democracy.},

Carnoy draws on interviews with researchers at Stanford to present the genesis of their key theoretical findings in their own words. Moving through them chronologically, Carnoy situates each work within its historical context, and argues that comparative education is strongly influenced by its economic and political environment. Ultimately, he discusses the potential influence of feminist theory, organizational theory, impact evaluation, world society theory, and state theory on comparative work in the future, and the political and economic changes that might inspire new directions in the field.},

These processes include: the terms of inclusion of paid workers in global production systems, the barriers to inclusion of the self-employed in global production systems, and the patterns of exclusion from domestic production systems associated with imports and other aspects of trade liberalization. The authors argue that global integration is a 'political' outcome, meaning that formulating the right policies can lead to a better and more just globalization. They recommend a mix of protective measures for paid workers, policy, regulatory, and institutional reforms, and promote the representation of informal workers/producers. Unfavourable patterns of exclusion/inclusion are seen as a cause of income poverty, so by applying the appropriate policies a fairer globalization can be reached.},

In September 2009, epidemic cholera was detected in the Far North region of Cameroon and the reported case-fatality rate was 12\%. We conducted village-, healthcare facility- and community-level surveys to investigate reasons for excess cholera mortality. Results of this investigation suggest that cholera patients who died were less likely to seek care, receive rehydration therapy and antibiotics at a healthcare facility, and tended to live further from healthcare facilities. Furthermore, use of oral rehydration salts at home was very low in both decedents and survivors.

Why and how do local aid projects increase individualsâ€™ perceptions of corruption in recipient communities? Using a geocoded dataset of Chinese official finance flows along with Afrobarometer survey data, I explore the effects of Chinese aid on corruption perceptions among citizens in African states. The main results indicate that exposure to Chinese assistance increases the perceived level of corruption of government officials and political leaders, while World Bank aid does not. I also examine whether the types and targeted sectors of aid have differential impacts on individual perceptions of political corruption. The results indicate that grants have a more consistent impact on corruption perceptions than do other types of aid, suggesting that grants may provide rents more easily to politicians. Besides, developmental projects for social infrastructure raise respondentsâ€™ reports of dishonesty among public officials more than other sectors. It is because those projects substitute essential public services, thus lowering the accountability of local governments. Moreover, when Chinese agencies implement projects by themselves, the impact of Chinese aid on corruption perceptions increases substantially. The findings suggest that Chinese aid may increase the awareness of political corruption in local African communities, due primarily to suspicions regarding interactions between China and local people in African states.},

The HPI was introduced in the United Nations Development Programme Human Development Report 1997 and concentrates on deprivations in basic dimensions of life. This paper develops an axiomatic characterization of a family of global deprivation indices using an arbitrary number of dimensions of human life. When we consider only the three basic dimensions, a member of this family becomes ordinally equivalent to HPI. The general index allows the calculation of percentage contributions of deprivations in different dimensions, and hence to identify the dimensions whose failures affect the overall deprivation more. This is important from a policy perspective. We also provide an empirical illustration of the characterized indices using cross-country data for the three basic dimensions and the anthropometric indicators birth weight, height for age and nourishment.},

In order to work towards aggregate indices that are more sensitive to gender gaps in poverty as identified and experienced by poor women, the main aims of this paper are twoâ€fold. The first is to draw attention to existing conceptual and methodological weaknesses with the â€œfeminization of povertyâ€, and to suggest how the construct could better depict contemporary trends in gendered privation. The second is to propose directions for the kinds of data and indicators that might be incorporated within the Genderâ€related Development Index or the Gender Empowerment Measure, or used in the creation of a Gendered Poverty Index.},

Unfortunately, we know relatively little about why this is the case. For one, there is almost never a theoretical justification for the inclusion of colonial history in statistical models. For the other, the only explicitly made rationale by Bueno de Mesquita and Smith (2009) actually predicts an interpretational problem: colonial history not only increases a former colonyâ€™s saliency to the donor, but also has left deep marks on recipientsâ€™ social and political institutions today. Both aspects shape how much aid a donor transfers to the recipient. This leaves ambiguous the meaning of the routinely found positive, sizable, and significant coefficient of colonial history on aid flows. We solve the inferential quandary by using a decomposition approach from labor econometrics. Our results show that about 75â€“100\% of the colony effect on foreign aid stems from the greater saliency that donors give to policy concessions from former colonies.},

We seek to remedy this deficiency by creating an index aimed at measuring the extensity of capital controls based on the information from the IMF's Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions (AREAER). This paper details how we construct the data and where our index stands in relation to the extant literature. Given the intricacy of capital controls policies and regulations, the exercise of quantifying the extent of financial openness remains a challenging task. Nonetheless, our index makes a substantial contribution in terms of its coverage of countries and time period; the data are available for 181 countries for the 1970â€“2005 period.},

  abstract = {The staff play a key part in designing IMF conditionality, and yet the literature provides a narrow view of their motivations. This article shows how the design of IMF conditionality is linked to the normative orientations of the staff and their common professional training. Professional ties from similar training help to bind the staff together around a shared set of normative orientations that inform the IMFâ€™s policy goals. When borrowing country officials do not share these orientations, the staff are motivated to tighten conditionality. This behavior also fits with staff concerns about time-inconsistency and moral hazard. I find robust statistical support for this argument using a dataset based on the professional ties that exist between the IMF staff and borrowing country officials. Yet conditionality is not found to be more lenient when country officials share the normative orientations of the IMF staff. Staff concerns about time-inconsistent preferences and moral hazard likely weigh against more lenient treatment where normative adherence is stronger.},

All analyses were done at the country level and then aggregated to seven regions: World Bank high-income countries and the six WHO regions (ie, Africa, the Americas, Southeast Asia, Europe, Eastern Mediterranean, and Western Pacific).{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Findings{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Globally, in 2019, 2Â·41 billion (95\% uncertainty interval 2Â·34â€“2Â·50) individuals had conditions that would benefit from rehabilitation, contributing to 310 million [235â€“392] YLDs. This number had increased by 63\% from 1990 to 2019. Regionally, the Western Pacific had the highest need of rehabilitation services (610 million people [588â€“636] and 83 million YLDs [62â€“106]).

The paper examines the causes, consequences, and potential solutions to three â€˜data dividesâ€™ â€“ access to data, representation of the world as data, and control over data flows â€“ through examples of digital identity systems and national data infrastructures, user-generated data, and personal behavioral data produced through corporate platforms. This understanding provides a basis for future research, practice, and policymaking on data-related (in)equalities in development contexts and beyond.},

In this article, we first assess how adaptation finance came to the top of the agenda. Second, drawing upon Amartya Sen's (2010) "realization-focused comparison" theory of justice, we develop a definition of adaptation finance justice based upon the texts of the 1992 UNFCCC and its subsidiary bodies. From this perspective, we assess three main points of contention between countries on both sides of the North-South divide: The Gap in raising the funds, The Wedge in their distribution, and The Dodge in how they are governed. Overall, we argue that while some ambiguity exists, the decisions of the UNFCCC provide a strong basis for a justice-oriented approach to adaptation finance. However, in practice, adaptation finance has reflected developed country interests far more than the principles of justice adopted by Parties.},

This paper introduces an econometric strategy for estimating individual or household-level development resilience from panel data. Estimation of multiple conditional moments of a welfare functionâ€”itself specified to permit potentially nonlinear path dynamicsâ€”enables the computation and forecasting of individual-specific conditional probabilities of satisfying a normative minimum standard of living. We then develop a decomposable resilience measure that enables aggregation of the individual-specific estimates to targetable subpopulation- and population-level measures. We illustrate the method empirically using household panel data from pastoralist communities in northern Kenya. The results demonstrate the method and its potential for targeting resilience-building interventions.},

Using an underutilized data set on the conditions associated with World Bank loans, we find that borrower countries that vote with the United States at the United Nations are required to enact fewer domestic policy reforms, and on fewer and softer issue areas. Though U.S. preferences permeate World Bank decision making, we do not find evidence that borrower countries trade favors in exchange for active U.S. intervention on their behalf. Instead, we propose that U.S. influence operates indirectly when World Bank staffâ€”consciously or unconsciouslyâ€”design programs that are compatible with U.S. preferences. Our study provides novel evidence of World Bank conditionality and shows that politicized policies can result even from autonomous bureaucracies.},

This group of small nations, largely unnoticed by the industrialized West, are dropping further and further behind the majority of the world's people, often falling into an absolute decline in living standards. A struggle rages within each of these nation between reformers and corrupt leaders--and the corrupt are winning.

We also describe approaches to the use of ethnicity measures in cross-national comparative research. We emphasise the value of sensitivity analyses. We also encourage researchers to carefully consider the possible relationships between ethnicity and other important variables in order to avoid spurious interpretations of the effects of ethnicity.},

More specifically, we show that G20 diplomacy often reproduces many oligarchic tendencies in global governance, while also relaxing club dynamics in some ways. On the one hand, the G20 has more inductees who operate along new rules of the game and under a new multilateral ethos of difference. But, on the other hand, the G20 still comprises self-appointed rulers, with arbitrary rules of membership and many processes of cooption and discipline. In overall terms, approaching G20 diplomacy from a practice perspective not only provides us with the necessary analytical granularity to tell the old from the new, it also sheds different light on the dialectics of stability and change on the world stage. Practices are processes and as such they are always subject to evolutionary change. However, because of their structuring effects, diplomatic practices also tend to inhibit global transformation and reproduce the existing order.},

  abstract = {"Data is fundamental to the modern world. From economic development to health care to education and public policy, we rely on numbers to allocate resources and make crucial decisions. But because so much data fails to take into account gender, because it treats men as the default and women as atypical, bias and discrimination are baked into our systems. And women pay tremendous costs for this bias, in time, money, and often with their lives. Celebrated feminist advocate Caroline Criado Perez investigates this shocking root cause of gender inequality in Invisible Women. Examining the home, the workplace, the public square, the doctor's office, and more, Criado Perez unearths a dangerous pattern in data and its consequences on women's lives. Product designers use a 'one-size-fits-all' approach to everything from pianos to cell phones to voice recognition software, when in fact this approach is designed to fit men. Cities prioritize men's needs when designing public transportation, roads, and even snow removal, neglecting to consider women's safety or unique responsibilities and travel patterns. And in medical research, women have largely been excluded from studies and textbooks, leaving them chronically misunderstood, mistreated, and misdiagnosed. Built on hundreds of studies in the US, the UK, and around the world, and written with energy, wit, and sparkling intelligence, this is a groundbreaking, highly readable exposÃ© that will change the way you look at the world"--Jacket},

Using Chinese customs transactions between 2000 and 2009, we exploit time-variation in product-level trade policy and find that Chinese firms are less likely to enter new foreign markets and more likely to exit from established foreign markets when their products are subject to increased trade policy uncertainty. Our analysis is based on the phenomenon of â€œtariff echoingâ€ â€“ after a tariff hike in one country, another country is likely to raise its tariff on the same product. Overall, we find that if there had been no trade policy uncertainty created by the use of contingent tariffs, Chinese entry into foreign markets would have been roughly 2\% higher per year. We use our model to counterfactually estimate how much entry by Chinese firms over 2001â€“2009 was due to future trade policy certainty provided by membership in the WTO.},

  abstract = {Thus far, efforts of the Green Climate Fund (GCF) to mobilize finance have failed to meet the needs of developing countries for addressing climate change. How the GCFâ€™s limited funds could be used to leverage additional financial resources has therefore become a key challenge. This study investigates whether the experience of the Global Environment Facility (GEF), especially with co-financing, could offer useful lessons. It analyzes 4,574 projects implemented by the GEF and investigates how leverage has been used to acquire greater international environmental assistance. We find that the co-financing ratio of GEF grants increased from 3.95â€“7.69 during 1991â€“2018, and climate change projects show the strongest leverage potential. We also find that the GEF generates different co-financing effects on different receipts, being higher in emerging economies and lower in low-income countries. These lessons are applied to GCF fundraising to determine which of four different funding allocation mechanisms could achieve the maximum co-financing effect. If the GCF follows the GEF leverage ratio, then the co-financing achieved by the proposed Carbon Reduction Contribution Principle (CC) allocation mechanism is the highest, while that of the Adaptation Needs Principle (AN) is the lowest. Although emerging economies are generally richer than other developing countries, excluding emerging economies from the GCF is not a wise option as it not only inhibits co-financing, but also weakens the climate mitigation purpose of the GCF. Key policy insights Emerging economies are able to leverage more co-financing than lower income countries. The GCF should therefore reserve partial grants for emerging economies to enhance total co-financing. To balance the allocation of funds among recipients, the GCF should set different co-financing standards for different developing countries, with emerging economies required to secure more co-financing than lower income countries. Regional co-financing ratios of the GEF for climate change purposes can be used as a reference. Co-financing will make climate mitigation more attractive than climate adaptation. The GCF should therefore balance the three targets of co-financing, climate mitigation and climate adaptation together to achieve a more equitable and effective use of the fund.},

Like the World Bank group, each RDB comprises a cluster of affiliated  agencies. At the core of each cluster is a non-concessional 'Bank' or 'ordinary capital' lending facility, analogous to the World Bank's IBRD window, along with a concessional lending window or 'Fund', analogous to IDA. Although similar to each other and to the World Bank group in their fundamental purposes, structure and operations, there are subtle differences between them. Each of the RDBS has a unique constitution shaped by the particular exigencies which led to their establishment.},

Nonetheless I worry that an overemphasis on household and personal Â· sphere fossil fuel emissions distracts from attention to higher-level corporate and governmental responsibilities for addressing the problem of climate change. I argue that more attention should be placed on the higher-level responsibilities of corporations and governments, and I discuss how individuals might more effectively take responsibility for addressing global climate change, especially when corporations and governments refuse to do so.},

Based on National Sample Survey data of India, the analysis finds that income has a low impact, while non-economic factors have an equal or higher impact on access to and use of latrines. The number of household members has a negative impact on both access to and use of latrines. Access to and use of latrines depends on gender, age, and education of the household head. Both access and use also depend on the main occupation, religion, and caste of households. Access to water supply and dwelling materials also impacts access to and use of latrines. Households headed by younger people or those living in hired houses are more likely to access public or common latrines. Access to sanitation also depends on the region and hence the norms and customs of the region. Contrary to expectations, a lesser proportion of households have access to latrines if they own a house versus those who reside in hired dwellings. Quality, cleanliness of latrines and other personal preferences matter in the use of latrines. Public and community toilets for youths, more than one latrine for larger households, and social campaigning are suggested for public policy.},

ASPIRE toolkit uses qualitative evidence which feeds into 96 indicators producing visual outputs which can encourage users to consider contextual issues and develop valuable trade-offs between the four dimensions. The methodology and toolkit are applied to the evaluation of an infrastructure upgrading project in Korail, Bangladesh. The Urban Partnership for Poverty Reduction Project (UPPRP) in Korail supports a twin-pronged approach of provision of infrastructure (water, sanitation, roads and drainage) improvement through the Slum Improvement Fund and improvement of socio-economic conditions through the Socio-Economic Funds. The ASPIRE assessment allowed the authors to interrogate strengths and weaknesses of the UPPR project thereby demonstrating the value added by ASPIRE. Overall, the project was deemed successful in Korail. Socially, it allowed access to all types of services to the slum's residents with strong community engagement. Land security however was noted to be a challenge, which needs to be addressed by institutions in Dhaka.},

This bias obscures a proper understanding of the developmental causes and consequences of migration at the sending end. The reciprocal migration -- development relationship is examined through the discussion of seven migration 'myths'. Because of its profound developmental roots, it is useless to think that migration can be halted or that aid and trade are short-cut 'solutions' to immigration. Migrant remittances contribute significantly to development and living conditions in sending countries. Nevertheless, the recent 'remittance euphoria' is not justified, because unattractive investment environments and restrictive immigration policies which interrupt circular migration patterns prevent the high development potential of migration from being fully realised. Although specific policies can enhance this potential through facilitating remittance transfers and investments, the key lies in encouraging circular migration. Instead of uselessly and harmfully trying to stop inevitable migration, immigration policies allowing for freer circulation can, besides increasing migration control, enhance the vital contribution of migrants to the development of their home countries.},

  abstract = {The debate on migration and development has swung back and forth like a pendulum, from developmentalist optimism in the 1950s and 1960s, to neo-Marxist pessimism over the 1970s and 1980s, towards more optimistic views in the 1990s and 2000s. This paper argues how such discursive shifts in the migration and development debate should be primarily seen as part of more general paradigm shifts in social and development theory. However, the classical opposition between pessimistic and optimistic views is challenged by empirical evidence pointing to the heterogeneity of migration impacts. By integrating and amending insights from the new economics of labor migration, livelihood perspectives in development studies and transnational perspectives in migration studies â€“ which share several though as yet unobserved conceptual parallels â€“ this paper elaborates the contours of a conceptual framework that simultaneously integrates agency and structure perspectives and is therefore able to account for the heterogeneous nature of migration-development interactions. The resulting perspective reveals the naivety of recent views celebrating migration as self-help development â€œfrom belowâ€. These views are largely ideologically driven and shift the attention away from structural constraints and the vital role of states in shaping favorable conditions for positive development impacts of migration to occur.},

  abstract = {International Relations scholars pay increasing attention to markets as a driver of international cooperation. In international development, market principles pervade donor decision-making about foreign aid allocation and delivery. An important aspect of this trend is that, increasingly, like-minded (as in pro-market) donor governments cooperate to promote market-oriented development policies, while the ones who do not share this view are less likely to engage in this mode of cooperation. In this article, we use network analysis to explore patterns of collaboration between donors through trust funds. These funds are ad-hoc policy venues and financing vehicles hosted by international organizations. They allow like-minded donors to support joint priority areas, while also acting as conduits for policy learning. In a first step, we describe the network of donor cooperation that emerges through the use of joint trust funds and explore how this network varies with different types of funds. We expect that cooperative donor networks are particularly likely to emerge in sectors that allow for easy attribution of results (e.g. education, health, and emergencies) and that adopt private sector principles in their governance. Moreover, trust funds differentially drive international cooperation, depending on the political economy of donor countries. We then test market-based explanations for donor collaboration using ERGM analysis. Our project thus contributes to the study of international cooperation by mapping donor political economies to networks of donor cooperation.},

We focus instead on the system, presenting the first evidence that altering the design of an interactive visualization tool can mitigate a strong bias - the attraction effect. Participants viewed 2D scatterplots where choices between superior alternatives were affected by the placement of other suboptimal points. We found that highlighting the superior alternatives weakened the bias, but did not eliminate it. We then tested an interactive approach where participants completely removed locally dominated points from the view, inspired by the elimination by aspects strategy in the decision-making literature. This approach strongly decreased the bias, leading to a counterintuitive suggestion: tools that allow removing inappropriately salient or distracting data from a view may help lead users to make more rational decisions.},

Bearing this in mind, the main goal of this paper is to present an I-distance methodology that holds a new perspective on the measurement of information development, to compare it to the ICT development index (IDI), and to point out improvements that such methodology provides. IDI combines 11 indicators related to three ICT categories: Access, Use and Skills (by weighting the first two by 40 percent and the third by 20 percent). The approach presented in this study uses the same indicators, synthesizing them into one value. Subsequently, which variables are the most relevant for measuring ICT development level of countries are able to be determined. Consequently, the I-distance method provides useful insight into developing countries and ways that enhance their ranking. The results show that the correlation between the I-distance values and IDI values is very strong, r = 0.961, p {$<$} 0.01, which makes I-distance an acceptable measurement method for evaluating countriesâ€™ ICT development levels.},

Water plays an important role in the production of energy, including renewable energy sources and the extraction of unconventional fossil fuels that are expected to become important players in future energy security. The emergent competition for water between the food and energy systems is increasingly recognized in the concept of the â€œfood-energy-water nexus.â€ The nexus between food and water is made even more complex by the globalization of agriculture and rapid growth in food trade, which results in a massive virtual transfer of water among regions and plays an important role in the food and water security of some regions. This review explores multiple components of the food-energy-water nexus and highlights possible approaches that could be used to meet food and energy security with the limited renewable water resources of the planet. Despite clear tensions inherent in meeting the growing and changing demand for food and energy in the 21st century, the inherent linkages among food, water, and energy systems can offer an opportunity for synergistic strategies aimed at resilient food, water, and energy security, such as the circular economy.},

Tracking this finance is particularly problematic for climate change adaptation, as there is no clear definition of what separates adaptation aid from standard development aid. Here we use a historical database of overseas development assistance projects to test the effect of different accounting assumptions on the delivery of adaptation finance to the developing countries of Oceania, using machine algorithms developed from a manual pilot study. The results show that explicit adaptation finance grew to 3\%â€“4\% of all development aid to Oceania by the 2008â€“2012 period, but that total adaptation finance could be as high as 37\% of all aid, depending on potentially politically motivated assumptions about what counts as adaptation. There was also an uneven distribution of adaptation aid between countries facing similar challenges like Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, and the Federated States of Micronesia. The analysis indicates that data allowing individual projects to be weighted by their climate change relevance is needed. A robust and mandatory metadata system for all aid projects would allow multilateral aid agencies and independent third parties to perform their own analyses using different assumptions and definitions, and serve as a key check on international climate aid promises.},

While political considerations shape China's allocation of aid, China does not pay substantially more attention to politics compared to Western donors. What is more, China's aid allocation seems to be widely independent of recipients' endowment with natural resources and institutional characteristics.

This concern assumes that a bureaucrat applies to his tasks the values and interests of his social background. Evidence from Zambia, a country in which ethnic and regional differences have been highly politicized, suggests that this assumption lacks empirical support. The fundamental guidelines that appear to shape administrative behavior in Zambia are the calculations of what must be done to achieve individual career advancement. Administrators are, in addition, constrained from pursuing parochial interests by the range of authority and discretion attached to their particular positions.             Although bureaucrats do not appear to provide ideal representatives for ethnic interests, the ethnic composition of the most visible echelons of the government is of critical political significance. This is particularly evident in a country like Zambia where ethnically defined groups are contending for positions in the new postcolonial society.

Black Americans suffer on nearly every measure of health in relation to white Americans. Five theoretical models have been proposed to explain these disparities: a racial-genetic model, a health-behavior model, a socioeconomic status model, a psychosocial stress model, and a structural-constructivist model. We selectively review literature on health disparities, emphasizing research on low birth weight and high blood pressure. The psychosocial stress model and the structural-constructivist model offer greatest promise to explain disparities. In future research, theoretical elaboration and operational specificity are needed to distinguish among three distinct factors: (a) genetic variants contributing to disease risk; (b) ethnoracial or folk racial categories masquerading as biology; and (c) ethnic group membership. Such elaboration is necessary to move beyond the conflation of these three distinct constructs that characterizes much of current research.},

  abstract = {Cholera, a water-borne bacteria infectious disease, shows clear spatial variation in its transmission pattern. It is thus important to incorporate understanding on the spatial variability of its transmission when making transmission prediction and intervention decisions. However, for an emerging cholera outbreak, transmission dynamics models are often uncertain as model parameters are indeterminate and epidemic state can only be partially observed. Hence, ensuing intervention decisions have to be made under uncertainty and thus the resultant optimization problem is challenging. In this paper, we study a multi-period location-specific resource allocation problem for cholera outbreak intervention with periodically acquired state information from different locations and increasingly understood transmission parameters over time. We formulate the problem as a nonlinear optimization model on a set of ordinary-differential-equations governing location-specific disease transmission dynamics. We propose a data-driven optimization approach to determine the optimal strategy of intervention resource allocation at each period and each community in a rolling-horizon manner. At each period, we integrate single-period model parameter fitting and scenario-based stochastic programming to make decisions under uncertainty with newly acquired system understanding. We conduct comparative studies to assess the performance of our data-driven optimization approach and offer insights into intervention resource allocation policy development. We conclude that our data-driven optimization approach is effective to multi-period decision problems under system dynamics with indeterminate parameters.},

It also discusses several solutions: structural equation modelling, survey data harmonization, big data, and mixed methods. The authors argue that factorial analysis within structural equation modelling invites new possibilities to measure intersections. Survey data harmonization, at a large enough scale, turns into big data with a sufficient number of cases to construct and analyse nuanced intersectional groups. The mixed method approach uses both quantitative data to generalize across populations and qualitative approaches to delve deep into social and political processes that can reveal and explain power structures.},

In contrast, policies specific to MÃ¤ori were usually introduced to encourage conformity to Western preferences. By the 20th century, although the rationale was inconsistent and frequently unclear, minority ethnicity reporting had become an accepted marker of social wellbeing. Sometimes it was used for political purposes and often as a proxy measure for socio-economic disadvantage. In that regard policies of equality between individuals and needs-based policies have tended to assume that ethnicity and race are significant only in as much as they can be subsumed under universal indicators such as social class, life expectancy and educational achievement. Twenty-first century research, however, has demonstrated that not only is socio-economic status distinguishable from ethnicity, but that universal indicators are insufficient measures of need and outcome for members of different ethnicities. Because race and ethnicity are closely aligned to world views, culture and lifestyle it is inconsistent with the evidence to exclude them from social and economic policies. Increasingly, race and ethnicity are visible characteristics of New Zealand society, and unless policies reflect that reality, diversity will be masked, best outcomes will be compromised, and assimilation will be fostered â€“ as it was in the 19th century.},

This paper addresses this criticism by providing a general rationale of the underlying methodological problem as well as by proposing a specific methodological approach tailored to correcting the arising bias. We illustrate the latter approach by using Austrian data from the Household Finance and Consumption Survey. Specifically, we identify suitable parameter combinations by using a series of maximumâ€likelihood estimates and appropriate goodnessâ€ofâ€fit tests to avoid arbitrariness with respect to the fitting of the Pareto distribution. Our results suggest that the alleged nonâ€observation bias is considerable, accounting for about one quarter of total net wealth in the case of Austria. The method developed in this paper can easily be applied to other countries where survey data on wealth are available.},

Individuals are heterogeneous with respect to their managerial ability, and firms run by more able managers have a higher productivity level and make higher profits. There is rent sharing at the firm level due to fair wage preferences of workers, and hence firms with higher profits pay higher wages in equilibrium in order to elicit their workers' full effort. We show that in this framework international trade leads to a self-selection of the best firms into export status, with exporting firms having to pay a wage premium. Aggregate welfare increases, but there is also larger inequality along multiple dimensions: Involuntary unemployment and income inequality between managers and workers increase, and so does inequality within these two subgroups of individuals, as measured by the respective Gini coefficients.},

This alternative to public financing is seen as a way both to minimize the inefficiencies of public administration and to avoid the need for external borrowing.In fact, for much of the nineteenth century, infrastructure projects were privately financed and built. This approach, however, did not obviate the need for government intervention and foreign capital. Because of the difficulties of assessing projects, investors were reluctant to commit their funds, and governments turned to subsidies and loan guarantees to encourage investment. Often, however, government intervention only replaced one set of problems with another. Investors with government-guaranteed loans had no incentive to monitor the firm's performanceâ€”a limitation that led to the diversion of funds and frustrated the public interest. This article draws out the implications of this experience for policymakers in developing countries today.},

  abstract = {This paper is motivated by a concern that adaptation and vulnerability research suffer from an under-theorization of the political mechanisms of social change and the processes that serve to reproduce vulnerability over time and space. We argue that adaptation is a socio-political process that mediates how individuals and collectives deal with multiple and concurrent environmental and social changes. We propose that applying concepts of subjectivity, knowledges and authority to the analysis of adaptation focuses attention on this socio-political process. Drawing from vulnerability, adaptation, political ecology and social theory literatures, we explain how power is reproduced or contested in adaptation practice through these three concepts. We assert that climate change adaptation processes have the potential to constitute as well as contest authority, subjectivity and knowledge, thereby opening up or closing down space for transformational adaptation. We expand on this assertion through four key propositions about how adaptation processes can be understood and outline an emergent empirical research agenda, which aims to explicitly examine these propositions in specific social and environmental contexts. We describe how the articles in this special issue are contributing to this nascent research agenda, providing an empirical basis from which to theorize the politics of adaptation. The final section concludes by describing the need for a reframing of adaptation policy, practice and analysis to engage with multiple adaptation knowledges, to question subjectivities inherent in discourses and problem understandings, and to identify how emancipatory subjectivities â€“ and thus the potential for transformational adaptation â€“ can be supported.},

Using a dataset covering more than 400 Paris Club agreements, this paper aims to fill that gap. It provides a comprehensive description of the evolving characteristics of these operations and studies the economic dynamics surrounding them. The progressive introduction of new terms of treatment gradually turned the Paris Club from a mere debt collector into a provider of sequential debt relief. The study finds that more generous restructuring conditions involving nominal relief are associated with higher economic growth. In contrast, agreements including only NPV relief have no positive impact on growth. However, the countries that get these restructuring conditions turn out to be more likely to pursue a prudent fiscal policy after the event than those receiving a nominal haircut. In other words, when deciding upon the type of relief to be granted through debt restructuring, the official sector faces a trade-off between the objectives of stimulating growth and fostering fiscal sustainability.},

Governance is in danger of losing all meaning precisely because it means many things to different people in varied locations. This is especially true in sub-Saharan Africa. Here, the postcolony takes many forms, reflecting the imperial project with painful accuracy. Offering a set of multidisciplinary analyses of governance in different sectors (crisis management, water, food security, universities), in different locales (including the African Union and specific regional contexts from West Africa, Zambia, to South Africa), and from different theoretical approaches (network to adversarial network governance, and beyond), this volume makes a useful addition to the growing debates on 'how to govern'. It steers away from offering a 'correct' definition of governance, or from promoting a particular position on postcoloniality. It gives no conclusion that neatly sums up all the arguments advanced. Instead, readers are invited to draw their own conclusions based on these differing approaches to and analyses of governance in the postcolony. As a robust, critical assessment of power and accountability in the sub-Saharan context, this collection brings together topical case studies that will be a valuable resource for those working in the field of African international relations, public policy, public management and administration.},

We find that although import competition reduces jobs, export expansion also creates a substantial number of jobs. At the industry level, job gains due to US export expansion largely offset job losses due to Chinese import competition, resulting in a net gain of 379 thousand jobs over 1991â€“2011 in our preferred estimate. At the commuting zone level, job gains and losses are roughly balanced, with a slight net loss of 68 thousand jobs and a substantial range around this preferred estimate depending on the specification.},

Some of these have become higher-order logics of action that guide and drive particular forms of institutional and organizational change. This article builds an analytical framework for empirically exploring logics of action in development cooperation and then explores a case of how two strong logics, those of 'cost-effectiveness' and 'gender equality and women's empowerment', respectively, contend in the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Drawing on contemporary sociological institutionalist theorization, the article thus contributes to discussions of ideas and logics of action in development cooperation by presenting how these can be approached analytically as they are at play in exactly that--action.},

While overall globalization is shown to loosen protection of the regularly employed, it increases regulation in the segment of limited-term contracts. We find the economic one to drive deregulation for the regularly employed, but the social one to be responsible for the better protection of workers in atypical employment. We offer political economy arguments as explanations for these differential effects.},

These goals can alter power relations, affect the distribution of resources, reorganize national and local priorities, create perverse incentives for performance, and produce narratives that shape thinking and communication. As the articles in the 2014 JHDC special issue showed, the MDGs had complex, often distorting, consequences which were often in tension with the (intangible and difficult to quantify) principles of equity, human agency and participation as the cornerstone of development. This issue focuses on SDGs and includes five case studies of this localization process in aid programming in the Valencia, national reporting by Sweden, farming collectives in South Africa, indigenous communities in Australia and New Zealand, and infrastructure development in Ecuador and Pakistan. A sixth paper examines the role of metrics in including Neglected Tropical Diseases in the SDGs. These papers are diverse in the research questions they ask but engage with the common themes of global goals as a tool of global governance and their disruptive effects on power structures. Using the framework of data infrastructureâ€”means of collection and analysis, social structures amongst actors, knowledge systemsâ€”this introduction highlights the insights that emerge.},

In this study, we propose extending the framing approach by incorporating insights from the literature on sensemaking to examine how and when opportunities for meaning creation open up and how this affects subsequent discursive processes. Connecting framing and sensemaking better enables us to examine how structural factors prompt and bound discursive processes, affecting when and where frame contests emerge. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by examining changes in the discourse of globalization. Using qualitative and quantitative analyses of newspaper articles and corporate press releases, we trace the emergence of globalization discourse, its diffusion, and the increasing contention that surrounds it. Our findings show how and where globalization discourse emerged in response to greater U.S. involvement with the international economy, and how later frame contests over the meaning of globalization have depended on the interests of the actors involved.},

To that end, we compare foreign to domestic acquisitions in addition to accounting for the impact of majority versus minority acquisitions after controlling for country and sector trends. The productivity of foreign acquired affiliates increases modestly after four years, but only when majority stakes are acquired by foreigners.

Recognized as essential for evaluating adaptation progress, there have been few attempts to develop systematic approaches for tracking adaptation. This is reflected in polarized opinions, contradictory findings, and lack of understanding on the state of adaptation globally. In this paper, we outline key methodological considerations necessary for adaptation tracking research to produce systematic, rigorous, comparable, and usable insights that can capture the current state of adaptation globally, provide the basis for characterizing and evaluating adaptations taking place, facilitate examination of what conditions explain differences in adaptation action across jurisdictions, and can underpin the monitoring of change in adaptation over time. Specifically, we argue that approaches to adaptation tracking need to (i) utilize a consistent and operational conceptualization of adaptation, (ii) focus on comparable units of analysis, (iii) use and develop comprehensive datasets on adaptation action, and (iv) be coherent with our understanding of what constitutes real adaptation. Collectively, these form the 4Cs of adaptation tracking (consistency, comparability, comprehensiveness, and coherency).},

  abstract = {The concepts of transparency and accountability are closely linked: transparency is supposed to generate accountability. This article questions this widely held assumption. Transparency mobilises the power of shame, yet the shameless may not be vulnerable to public exposure. Truth often fails to lead to justice. After exploring different definitions and dimensions of the two ideas, the more relevant question turns out tobe: what kinds of transparency lead to what kinds of accountability, and under what conditions? The article concludes by proposing that the concept can be unpacked in terms of two distinct variants. Transparency can be either 'clear'or 'opaque', while accountability can be either 'soft'or 'hard'.},

Here we describe and synthesize data sets and methodology to quantify the five major components of the global carbon budget and their uncertainties. Fossil CO\textsubscript{2} emissions (\emph{E}\textsubscript{FOS}) are based on energy statistics and cement production data, while emissions from land-use change (\emph{E}\textsubscript{LUC}), mainly deforestation, are based on land use and land-use change data and bookkeeping models. Atmospheric CO\textsubscript{2} concentration is measured directly and its growth rate (\emph{G}\textsubscript{ATM}) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The ocean CO\textsubscript{2} sink (\emph{S}\textsubscript{OCEAN}) and terrestrial CO\textsubscript{2} sink (\emph{S}\textsubscript{LAND}) are estimated with global process models constrained by observations. The resulting carbon budget imbalance (\emph{B}\textsubscript{IM}), the difference between the estimated total emissions and the estimated changes in the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere, is a measure of imperfect data and understanding of the contemporary carbon cycle. All uncertainties are reported as Â±1\emph{Ïƒ}. For the last decade available (2010â€“2019), \emph{E}\textsubscript{FOS} was 9.6\&thinsp;Â±\&thinsp;0.5\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{âˆ’1} excluding the cement carbonation sink (9.4\&thinsp;Â±\&thinsp;0.5\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{âˆ’1} when the cement carbonation sink is included), and \emph{E}\textsubscript{LUC} was 1.6\&thinsp;Â±\&thinsp;0.7\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{âˆ’1}. For the same decade, \emph{G}\textsubscript{ATM} was 5.1\&thinsp;Â±\&thinsp;0.02\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{âˆ’1} (2.4\&thinsp;Â±\&thinsp;0.01\&thinsp;ppm\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{âˆ’1}), \emph{S}\textsubscript{OCEAN} 2.5\&thinsp;Â±\&thinsp; 0.6\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{âˆ’1}, and \emph{S}\textsubscript{LAND} 3.4\&thinsp;Â±\&thinsp;0.9\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{âˆ’1}, with a budget imbalance \emph{B}\textsubscript{IM} of âˆ’0.1\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{âˆ’1} indicating a near balance between estimated sources and sinks over the last decade. For the year 2019 alone, the growth in \emph{E}\textsubscript{FOS} was only about 0.1\&thinsp;\% with fossil emissions increasing to 9.9\&thinsp;Â±\&thinsp;0.5\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{âˆ’1} excluding the cement carbonation sink (9.7\&thinsp;Â±\&thinsp;0.5\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{âˆ’1} when cement carbonation sink is included), and \emph{E}\textsubscript{LUC} was 1.8\&thinsp;Â±\&thinsp;0.7\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{âˆ’1}, for total anthropogenic CO\textsubscript{2} emissions of 11.5\&thinsp;Â±\&thinsp;0.9\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{âˆ’1} (42.2\&thinsp;Â±\&thinsp;3.3\&thinsp;GtCO\textsubscript{2}). Also for 2019, \emph{G}\textsubscript{ATM} was 5.4\&thinsp;Â±\&thinsp;0.2\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{âˆ’1} (2.5\&thinsp;Â±\&thinsp;0.1\&thinsp;ppm\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{âˆ’1}), \emph{S}\textsubscript{OCEAN} was 2.6\&thinsp;Â±\&thinsp;0.6\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{âˆ’1}, and \emph{S}\textsubscript{LAND} was 3.1\&thinsp;Â±\&thinsp;1.2\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{âˆ’1}, with a \emph{B}\textsubscript{IM} of 0.3\&thinsp;GtC. The global atmospheric CO\textsubscript{2} concentration reached 409.85\&thinsp;Â±\&thinsp;0.1\&thinsp;ppm averaged over 2019. Preliminary data for 2020, accounting for the COVID-19-induced changes in emissions, suggest a decrease in \emph{E}\textsubscript{FOS} relative to 2019 of about âˆ’7\&thinsp;\% (median estimate) based on individual estimates from four studies of âˆ’6\&thinsp;\%, âˆ’7\&thinsp;\%, âˆ’7\&thinsp;\% (âˆ’3\&thinsp;\% to âˆ’11\&thinsp;\%), and âˆ’13\&thinsp;\%. Overall, the mean and trend in the components of the global carbon budget are consistently estimated over the period 1959â€“2019, but discrepancies of up to 1\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{âˆ’1} persist for the representation of semi-decadal variability in CO\textsubscript{2} fluxes. Comparison of estimates from diverse approaches and observations shows (1) no consensus in the mean and trend in land-use change emissions over the last decade, (2) a persistent low agreement between the different methods on the magnitude of the land CO\textsubscript{2} flux in the northern extra-tropics, and (3) an apparent discrepancy between the different methods for the ocean sink outside the tropics, particularly in the Southern Ocean. This living data update documents changes in the methods and data sets used in this new global carbon budget and the progress in understanding of the global carbon cycle compared with previous publications of this data set (Friedlingstein et al., 2019; Le QuÃ©rÃ© et al., 2018b, a, 2016, 2015b, a, 2014, 2013).

  abstract = {Powerful international development institutions have called for a â€˜gender data revolution.â€™ They posit that progress on gender equality depends upon our collective ability to close â€˜the gender data gap,â€™ by which they mean that we know less about womenâ€™s lives than menâ€™s in statistical terms. Some feminists within and outside the academy treat the gender data revolution with suspicion, likening it to a â€˜measurement obsessionâ€™ (Liebowitz and Zwingel 2014) that is overly quantitative (Buss 2015) and ill-fit to capture the complexities of gender subordination. In this paper, we suggest that feminist geographers as academics and scholar-activists have a unique and important contribution to make to the gender data debate, which at present is largely aspatial. Drawing on empirical examples we first illustrate how feminist geographyâ€™s conceptual and methodological contributions enrich the gender data debate; second, we reflect on the possibilities and limitations of a practical intervention that we are currently staging as co-founders of a feminist research venture that seeks to shape policymaking, critically considering the possibilities and limitations of such an endeavour.},

  abstract = {Global development goals have become increasingly used by the UN and the international community to promote priority objectives. The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are the most prominent example of such goals but many others have been set since the 1960s. Despite their prominence and proliferation, little has been written about the concept of global goals as a policy tool, their effectiveness, limitations and broader consequences. This paper explores global development goals as a policy tool, and the mechanisms that have two types of effects: governance effects and knowledge effects. These effects lead to both intended and unintended consequences in influencing international development strategies and action. The paper analyses the MDGs as an example to argue that global goals activate the power of numbers to create incentives for national governments and others to mobilize for important objectives. But the powers of simplification, reification and abstraction lead to broader unintended consequences when the goals are misinterpreted as national planning targets and strategic agendas, and when they enter the language of development to redefine concepts such as development and poverty.},

Much of the problem is conceptual, as there is very little agreement on what constitutes high-quality government. The commentary suggests four approaches: (1) procedural measures, such as the Weberian criteria of bureaucratic modernity; (2) capacity measures, which include both resources and degree of professionalization; (3) output measures; and (4) measures of bureaucratic autonomy. It rejects output measures and suggests a two-dimensional framework of using capacity and autonomy as a measure of executive branch quality. This framework explains the conundrum of why low-income countries are advised to reduce bureaucratic autonomy while high-income ones seek to increase it.},

Much of the focus has been on mitigating greenhouse gas emissions to reduce the rate and magnitude of changes. Adapting to the impacts of those changes has received much less attention. In recent years, the development assistance community has recognized that climate change poses a stress on economic and social development in poor countries and has turned its attention to addressing climate stress. The US Agency for International Development developed a methodology of working with stakeholders to identify sources of climate related vulnerability and approaches to reducing that vulnerability. The methodology was developed iteratively with several pilot studies looking at vulnerability and adaptation in different sectors and settings.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

  abstract = {We call for strengthening the Global Financial Safety Net (GFSN) to manage the economic effects of the outbreak of COVID-19, in particular the massive capital outflows from emerging market and developing economies and the global shortage of dollar liquidity. Both the United Nations (UN) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimate that emerging market and developing countries (EMDEs) need an immediate \$2.5 trillion, yet the financing available to them is just \$700 to \$971 billion. To meet these immediate needs we propose to: (i) broaden the coverage of the Federal Reserve currency swaps; (ii) issue at least \$500 billion of Special Drawing Rights through the IMF; (iii) improve the IMFâ€™s precautionary and emergency facilities; (iv) establish a multilateral swap facility at the IMF; (v) increase the resources and geographic coverage of Regional Financial Arrangements; (vi) coordinate capital flow management measures; (vii) initiate debt restructuring and relief initiatives; and (viii) request that credit-rating agencies stop making downgrades during the emergency. It argues that beyond these immediate measures, leaders should swiftly move to address the following structural gaps in the GFSN: (i) agree on a quota reform at the IMF; (ii) create an appropriate Sovereign Debt Restructuring Regime; (iii) expand surveillance activity; and (iv) adopt IMF governance reform and strengthen its relations with all agents of the GFSN. All of these immediate and intermediate reforms must be calibrated toward a just transition to a more stable, inclusive, and sustainable global economy.},

  abstract = {The post-global financial crisis world will be increasingly dominated by China and the United States. What the de facto G2 do, together, independently or in conflict, will increasingly define the global bounds of the possible. Both countries want to embed their bilateral diplomacy in the multilateralism of the G20. The problem for the emergent G2 in G20 global architecture is that economic relations between China and the US will be increasingly difficult to manage. The large economic imbalances between the two countries, in which China buys American debt and Americans buy Chinese goods, will endure. Before the crisis, the codependence these imbalances created was a source of stability in Sinoâ€“American relations. After the crisis, they will be a source of frustration and conflict, as the second half of 2009 showed. To manage economic relations between China and the US effectively, the G20 agenda will have to move from crisis management to strategic planning for the global economy. The G20 will also have to become more institutionalized, but in a way that resembles more a nonexecutive board of directors of a multinational firm than a management committee of C-level executives. Policy Implications â€¢ The world will be characterized by a de facto Chinaâ€“US G2 after the financial crisis. â€¢ Despite new commitments from both countries, large-scale Chinaâ€“US economic imbalances will persist. â€¢ Dueling protectionism and economic nationalism are the biggest potential medium-term threats to Chinaâ€“US relations. â€¢ Nesting the de facto G2 in the de jure G20 is the best hope for managing Chinaâ€“US tensions. â€¢ The G20 should be institutionalized as the board of directors for overseeing the Bretton Woods system, not as a replacement for it.},

While some states have already achieved coverage of 90\% or more, in others the proportion served is as low as 22\%. There are also wide disparities between urban and rural households. Overall, more than 81.4\% of urban households, but only 30.7\% of rural households have a latrine. The difference varies widely across the country. Coverage has increased by 10.5\% over the decade from 2001. This progress also varied widely between states and between districts within each state; 6.3\% of districts made negative progress during that period. The variation between states and districts means that some have already achieved the Millennium Development Goal of halving the proportion of their population that lacks sanitation, while others, if they continue at the present rate, will not do so for many decades. Study of the causes of these differences offers the hope of finding ways to accelerate progress in the laggard states and districts. For example, we find a close association between district sanitation coverage and female literacy, suggesting an important role for education.},

It is usually presented as the intersection between environment, society and economy, which are conceived of as separate although connected entities. We would argue that these are not unified entities: rather they are fractured and multi-layered and can be considered at different spatial levels. The economy is often given priority in policies and the environment is viewed as apart from humans. They are interconnected, with the economy dependent on society and the environment while human existence and society are dependent on, and within the environment. The separation of environment, society and economy often leads to a narrow techno-scientific approach, while issues to do with society that are most likely to challenge the present socio-economic structure are often marginalized, in particular the sustainability of communities and the maintenance of cultural diversity.

  abstract = {The global community is committed to addressing malnutrition. And yet, coverage data for high-impact interventions along the continuum of care remain scarce due to several measurement and data collection challenges. In this analysis paper, we identify 24 nutrition interventions that should be tracked by all countries, and determine if their coverage is currently measured by major household nutrition and health surveys. We then present three case studies, using published literature and empirical data from large-scale initiatives, to illustrate the kind of data collection innovations that are feasible. We find that data are not routinely collected in a standardised way across countries for most of the core set of interventions. Case studiesâ€”of growth monitoring and screening for acute malnutrition, infant and young child feeding counselling, and nutrition monitoring in Indiaâ€”highlight both challenges and potential solutions. Advancing the nutrition intervention coverage measurement agenda is essential for sustained progress in driving down rates of malnutrition. It will require (1) global consensus on a core set of validated coverage indicators on proven, high-impact nutrition-specific interventions; (2) the inclusion of coverage measurement and indicator guidance in WHO intervention recommendations; (3) the incorporation of these indicators into data collection mechanisms and relevant intervention delivery platforms; and (4) an agenda for continuous measurement improvement.},

  abstract = {Strategic planning and appropriate development and management of water and sanitation services are strongly supported by accurate and accessible data. If adequately exploited, these data might assist water managers with performance monitoring, benchmarking comparisons, policy progress evaluation, resources allocation, and decision making. A variety of tools and techniques are in place to collect such information. However, some methodological weaknesses arise when developing an instrument for routine data collection, particularly at local level: i) comparability problems due to heterogeneity of indicators, ii) poor reliability of collected data, iii) inadequate combination of different information sources, and iv) statistical validity of produced estimates when disaggregated into small geographic subareas. This study proposes an improved approach for water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) data collection at decentralised level in low income settings, as an attempt to overcome previous shortcomings. The ultimate aim is to provide local policymakers with strong evidences to inform their planning decisions. The survey design takes the Water Point Mapping (WPM) as a starting point to record all available water sources at a particular location. This information is then linked to data produced by a household survey. Different survey instruments are implemented to collect reliable data by employing a variety of techniques, such as structured questionnaires, direct observation and water quality testing. The collected data is finally validated through simple statistical analysis, which in turn produces valuable outputs that might feed into the decision-making process. In order to demonstrate the applicability of the method, outcomes produced from three different case studies (Homa Bay District â€“Kenyaâ€“; Kibondo District â€“Tanzaniaâ€“; and Municipality of ManhiÃ§a â€“Mozambiqueâ€“) are presented.},

  abstract = {Background: Suicide is a relatively rare incident. Nevertheless, parts of the literature on intentional self-harm behaviour state that suicide is one of the leading causes of death. We aimed to assess the evidence behind the statement that suicide is a leading cause of death across all ages, with reference to the methods of ranking causes of death. Methods: Two sets of data were used: For the European Union (EU) we used cause specific mortality statistics from the European Statistical Office (Eurostat) for the data-year 2014, and globally and for the WHO European Region we used data from Global Health Estimates (GHE) 2015. We used different sets of rules to select mutually exclusive leading underlying causes of mortality for Europe (EU28). We also present lists with estimates of leading causes of death globally, and for the WHO European Region based on the GHE 2015. Results: In 2014, 1.2\% of all reported deaths in the Europe Union (EU28) were due to suicide, and 1.4\% globally (2015) according to the WHO estimates. In Europe, suicide was ranked as number 11 and 15 in the two different ranking lists we used, and according to GHE-2015, suicide was ranked as the 17th leading cause globally, and number 14 in the WHO European Region. Looking at the differences by sex, suicide for males was ranked as the ninth and the tenth leading cause of death in two ranking lists for the European Union. For females, suicide was number 13 in the first and 23 in the second list, respectively. Conclusions: Different cause lists and rules for ranking produce different leading causes of mortality. The quality of data can also affect the ranking. Our rankings suggested that suicide was not among the ten leading causes of death in Europe or globally. To ensure that ranking causes of death is not driven by political motives and funding considerations, standard methods and official tabulation lists should be used. The rankings do not necessarily present the causes of mortality of greatest public health importance.},

  abstract = {Leaders of the Group of 20 (G20) countries, representing 85 percent of the global economy, met by videoconference on March 26 to discuss the international response to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated economic disruptions. This yearâ€™s G20 host, Saudi Arabia, issued a 20-paragraph communiquÃ© on behalf of the group following the call. In it, leaders committed to doing â€œwhatever it takesâ€ to overcome the pandemic and laid out a number of individual and collective actions to address the health crisis, bolster the global economy, and assist countries in distress. However, the statement lacked concrete proposals, and questions remain about the extent to which major economies are committed to following through with a concerted international response to the crisis. Q1: Did the G20 live up to its billing as the premier forum for international economic cooperation? A1: No, certainly by comparison with the G20â€™s forceful role in the 2008-2009 global financial crisis. Leadersâ€™ commitment in the March 26 communiquÃ© to do â€œwhatever it takesâ€ to minimize the economic and social damage from the pandemic was a useful statement of shared purpose. However, the communiquÃ© essentially recounted and endorsed what national governments and central banks are already doing individually through aggressive fiscal and monetary policy. Despite early press reports suggesting injection of a new \$5 trillion in spending, this figure was merely an aggregation of existing measures by G20 countries. Nor did leaders provide any new framing of the economic challenges posed by the health crisis or offer guidance to policymakersâ€”whether in individual countries or in international organizations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or World Bankâ€”on additional measures needed. Q2: Where specifically did the G20 communiquÃ© fall short? A2: The communiquÃ©â€™s language on the health dimensions of the crisis largely repeats prior commitments to strengthen capacities to respond to potential infectious disease outbreaks, increase epidemic preparedness spending, and assess gaps in pandemic preparedness. There is good news in the tasking of the World Health Organization (WHO) to report on gaps in pandemic preparedness to a joint meeting of finance and health ministers, building on existing WHO work to foster such dialogues. That future meeting will bring together officials in charge of the health response with those in charge of the economic and financial response, recognizing the reality that sustainably addressing the economic fallout will depend on addressing its root cause , the pandemic itself. A further positive outcome would entail sustained investment in health-security preparedness, addressing a gap that long predates the current crisis. Engagement with the international financial institutions is another area where the virtual meeting made progress but failed to inspire with specific commitments. On the eve of the virtual meeting, the heads of the IMF and World Bank issued a statement asking â€œall official bilateral creditors to suspend debt payments from IDA [International Development Association] countries that request forbearance.â€ While G20 leaders made no such commitment, they did announce a forthcoming â€œaction planâ€ to deliver international financial assistance, at least opening the door to future bilateral debt relief. Other proposals, including calls for a fresh allocation of the IMFâ€™s â€œspecial drawing rights,â€ were not mentioned in the communiquÃ© but could be forthcoming. The brief section of the communiquÃ© on trade contained few new commitments and several caveats. It began with the phrase, â€œConsistent with the needs of our citizens,â€ which is code in such documents for individual countries to do whatever serves their national interests. The trade language also implicitly gave license to countries to impose restrictions on exports of medical supplies, food, and other critical supplies provided these are justified as â€œemergency measuresâ€ that are targeted and temporary. There was no explicit commitment to avoid protectionism or reduce tariffs and other barriers to trade. Energy is another area of missed opportunity. The G20 includes the three largest energy producers in the world: Saudi Arabia, Russia, and the United States. Two of the three have been openly sparring, pushing energy prices to record lows. While a specific commitment to cut back on production was not likely to be forthcoming, the absence of any language on energy suggests that the scope for cooperative approaches in the G20 is limited. Q3: What do the outcomes of the G20 meeting say about the current effectiveness of multilateral cooperation? A3: Unlike the early G20 leadersâ€™ communiquÃ©s during the global financial crisis in 2008-2009, the G20â€™s March 26 statement fails to convey a spirit of robust internationalism and multilateral cooperation. It is short on new actions and commitments. Despite the aggressive fiscal and monetary policy responses by individual countries, in this case, the whole is less than the sum of its parts. The limited results reflect various fissures in the G20. Most important are the tensions between the groupâ€™s two largest members, the United States and China. In 2008-2009, Washington and Beijing were able to overcome their differences and find common cause in responding forcefully to the global financial crisis. With recent disputes over trade, technology, and other issues already casting a shadow over the relationship, a war of words between Washington and Beijing over the origins of the current pandemic has effectively undermined any residual willingness of the two sides to work together. The U.S.-China differences have also driven a further wedge between Washington and its closest allies. The G20 communiquÃ© came a day after G7 foreign ministers could not agree on a joint statement because of reported U.S. insistence on labeling COVID-19 the â€œWuhan virus,â€ which other G7 countries saw as unnecessarily antagonistic to China. Until these fissures among major economies are healed, multilateral cooperation to address the pandemic and its associated economic disruptions is likely to continue to fall short. Matthew P.

How a country fares in these assessments has come to signify not only how a nationâ€™s education system is performing, but also its future prospects in a global economic â€˜raceâ€™. These assessments provoke passionate arguments at specialist conferences and in scholarly journals and they are just as passionately debated in the media. Within academe, ILSAs are researched by sociologists and psychometricians, policy experts and statisticians. This multidisciplinary, multi-voice discussion has not always served to highlight the complexity of the issues involved. Instead, discussions across various groups of actors have often led to a polarisation of views and a hardening of stances. Large-scale comparisons have deeply divided academic opinion with regard to their validity, usefulness and use. The divergence in ontological commitments, methodologies and paradigms of research makes discussions among one set of scholars almost incomprehensible to another. New theories, concepts and vocabularies are urgently required to engage productively with this important phenomenon. Borrowing concepts from Science and Technology Studies (STS) and the history and sociology of numbers, I argue that understanding such comparative exercises as socio-technical assemblages would move the critique of large-scale comparisons in education in more productive directions.},

Context: The International Health Regulations (IHR) have been the governing framework for global health security for the past decade and are a nearly universally recognized World Health Organization (WHO) treaty, with 196 States Parties. In the wake of the Ebola epidemic, major global commissions have cast doubt on the future effectiveness of the IHR and the leadership of the WHO. Methods: We conducted a review of the historical origins of the IHR and their performance over the past 10 years and analyzed all of the ongoing reform panel efforts to provide a series of politically feasible recommendations for fundamental reform. Findings: We propose a series of recommendations with realistic pathways for change. These recommendations focus on the development and strengthening of IHR core capacities; independently assessed metrics; new financing mechanisms; harmonization with the Global Health Security Agenda, Performance of Veterinary Services (PVS) Pathways, the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework, and One Health strategies; public health and clinical workforce development; Emergency Committee transparency and governance; tiered public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) processes; enhanced compliance mechanisms; and an enhanced role for civil society. Conclusions: Empowering the WHO and realizing the IHR's potential will shore up global health securityâ€”a vital investment in human and animal healthâ€”while reducing the vast economic consequences of the next global health emergency.

However, due to the duty of loyalty to which civil servants of the European Union submit, these policies only satisfy the criterion of passive representation.

This study models the effects of trade on employment in the UK in a dynamic labour demand framework, on a panel of 167 manufacturing industries. We find that when we introduce trade, increases in trade volumes, both in terms of imports and exports, cause reductions in the level of derived labour demand. When we disaggregate by origin of imports we find stronger effects in trade with the EU and US compared to trade with East Asia. This provides supportive evidence for the idea that trade affects x-inefficiency, with the strongest competition for UK manufacturers coming from producers in the EU and US.},

This measure of comparative performance of educational systems of member and other nations is based on tests commissioned by the OECD. The paper discusses the role of the OECD in establishing the â€˜comparativeâ€™ turn and also describes PISA, its management and effects. It provides three examples of the impact of PISA in Finland, Germany and the UK before moving the focus to its impacts at the transnational level, through an examination of how key European policy actors see PISA and its effects. The paper concludes that PISA, through its direct impact on national education systems in Europe and beyond, has become an indirect, but nonetheless influential tool of the new political technology of governing the European education space by numbers.},

By combining the PIAAC-based skills indicators with OECD Trade in Value Added (TiVA) data, light is shed on the way skills and their distributions (at the country-industry level) relate to industry performance and to integration into global value chains (GVCs). The results underline the importance of cognitive skills such as literacy, numeracy and problem solving for any industry to thrive in the global economy. Also, a persistent and positive association with labour productivity and participation in GVCs is observed, at the industry level, for non-cognitive skills such as managing and communication skills, ICT skills and workersâ€™ readiness to learn and to think creatively.},

Countries are matched according to observable characteristics to create a suitable counterfactual. We correspondingly estimate a panel data model for the whole sample and the matched sample and compare the results to those obtained using an instrumental variable approach. The main results indicate that Kyoto Protocol commitments have a measurable reducing effect on CO2 emissions, indicating that a treaty often deemed a 'failure' may in fact be producing some non-negligible effects for those who signed it.},

Changes in international production systems are examined with particular attention given to four key sectors heavily integrated into global value chains (GVCs): Textiles and Apparel; Chemicals; ICT and Electronics; and, Motor Vehicles. Some insights into the roles played by services sectors and non-residentsâ€™ expenditure and, the employment and environmental impacts of GVCs, are also provided. Considerable heterogeneity across countries and regions is revealed, particularly for East and Southeast Asian where China plays a key role. Services are increasingly important for manufactured exporting activities as well as for countries wishing to â€œupgradeâ€ their activities to higher value added stages of production. Taking a consumption perspective suggests that national efforts to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions could be affected by international outsourcing of production.},

The author states her intention to explore some of the theoretical and practical dilemmas of researching "race" and ethnicity. This is, without question, achieved. I recommend it as essential reading for those concerned with increasing their awareness of issues relating to race, ethnicity and research practice' - Nurse Researcher  'This is a thought-provoking and challenging book which demonstrated the fractured and fluid nature of difference and power in the research process. Importantly it offers a guide to the ways in which research can be effectively and productively used in challenging the status quo' - Diversity in Health and Social Care  Researching `Race' and Ethnicity provides an innovative discussion of the methodological, epistemological and ethical challenges of doing qualitative research that is informed by questions of `race', ethnicity and social difference. By identifying and challenging `categorical thinking' and many longstanding assumptions about the meanings of `race' and ethnicity, the author gets to the heart of many of the everyday dilemmas and difficulties that researchers confront in the field, but are rarely theorised or openly discussed.  Yasmin Gunaratnam's insistence that `race' and ethnicity are a significant part of all qualitative research, and are not the `specialist' concerns of those whose work is explicitly focussed upon `race', provokes a radical rethinking of current methological debates. How do racial and ethnic categories inform our approaches to research? How does the racialised indentity of the researcher and the research participants affect the research interaction and the knowledge that we produce? What are the assumptions that are made about racialised subjectivity and inter-subjectivity? How can we make sense of accounts in which `race' and ethnicity are silent or are non-manifest? How can we work ethically across difference?  In examining these and other questions, the wide-ranging discussions in the book are animated by examples drawn from the author's ethnographic research with white and minoritized research participants. Through these examples readers will be able to engage with some of the complexities of research relationships, power relations and ethical concerns about engagement, disconnection and complicity in research. The attention that the book gives to the excluded experiences of minoritized researchers will be of particular value to many readers.  Researching `Race' and Ethnicity is essential reading for students and academics in the social sciences.},

However, in the eyes of many water experts, SDG 6 indicators are far from perfect. It is important to systematically identify and prioritise the gaps and weaknesses in the SDG 6 indicator framework to address them effectively. This paper identifies two potential gaps: first, between the aspirations captured in SDG 6 targets and what will be measured by the relevant indicators; and second, between what is being measured in â€˜means of implementationâ€™ indicators and what the key means of implementation achievements of many countries are expected to be under SDG 6. Three existing mechanismsâ€”complementary indicators, international support and an integrated approachâ€”are briefly described, and it is proposed that they may potentially be harnessed to assist national governments to address the two types of gaps identified for SDG 6. There is also an opportunity for stakeholders to help erase the gaps in a comprehensive review of SDG indicators, though how open and participatory the full review process will be is not yet clear.},

Many have generated self-reported emission inventories, but their value to emissions mitigation depends on their accuracy, which remains untested. Here, we compare self-reported inventories from 48 US cities to independent estimates from the Vulcan carbon dioxide emissions data product, which is consistent with atmospheric measurements. We found that cities under-report their own greenhouse gas emissions, on average, by 18.3\% (range: âˆ’145.5\% to +63.5\%) â€“ a difference which if extrapolated to all U.S. cities, exceeds Californiaâ€™s total emissions by 23.5\%. Differences arise because city inventories omit particular fuels and source types and estimate transportation emissions differently. These results raise concerns about self-reported inventories in planning or assessing emissions, and warrant consideration of the new urban greenhouse gas information system recently developed by the scientific community.},

The original index was introduced by Dreher (Applied Economics, 38(10):1091â€“1110, 2006) and updated in Dreher et al. (2008). This second revision of the index distinguishes between de facto and de jure measures along the different dimensions of globalization. We also disentangle trade and financial globalization within the economic dimension of globalization and use time-varying weighting of the variables. The new index is based on 43 instead of 23 variables in the previous version. Following Dreher (Applied Economics, 38(10):1091â€“1110, 2006), we use the new index to examine the effect of globalization on economic growth. The results suggest that de facto and de jure globalization influence economic growth differently. Future research should use the new KOF Globalisation Index to re-examine other important consequences of globalization and why globalization was proceeding rapidly in some countries, such as South Korea, but less so in others.

  abstract = {At the UN in New York the Open Working Group created by the UN General Assembly proposed a set of global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which comprises 17 goals and 169 targets. Further to that, a preliminary set of 330 indicators was introduced in March 2015. Some SDGs build on preceding Millennium Development Goals while others incorporate new ideas. A critical review has revealed that indicators of varied quality (in terms of the fulfilment certain criteria) have been proposed to assess sustainable development. Despite the fact that there is plenty of theoretical work on quality standards for indicators, in practice users cannot often be sure how adequately the indicators measure the monitored phenomena. Therefore we stress the need to operationalise the Sustainable Development Goalsâ€™ targets and evaluate the indicatorsâ€™ relevance, the characteristic of utmost importance among the indicatorsâ€™ quality traits. The current format of the proposed SDGs and their targets has laid a policy framework; however, without thorough expert and scientific follow up on their operationalisation the indicators may be ambiguous. Therefore we argue for the foundation of a conceptual framework for selecting appropriate indicators for targets from existing sets or formulating new ones. Experts should focus on the â€œindicator-indicated factâ€ relation to ensure the indicatorsâ€™ relevance in order for clear, unambiguous messages to be conveyed to users (decision- and policy-makers and also the lay public). Finally we offer some recommendations for indicators providers in order to contribute to the tremendous amount of conceptual work needed to lay a strong foundation for the development of the final indicators framework.},

The article then considers the implications of transparency-based accountability for larger questions of global governance, especially its potential to create the kind of nonterritorial, problem-based polities that scholars have called for to address problems that transcend national boundaries.},

These are important demonstrations of the international community's on-going efforts to shift more power to those affected by disasters and to help ensure their dignity throughout the response and recovery efforts. This paper takes these commitments and applies them to the international humanitarian response following TC Pam in Vanuatu to gain greater insight into the implementation of these high-level goals. TC Pam caused massive damage as it tracked across Vanuatu in March 2015 and is still the largest tropical cyclone on record in the south Pacific. This paper clarifies the following contributions: USD 37.04 m to the response efforts, and USD 147.45 m to the on-going recovery from the tropical cyclone. It documents where that money came from, where it went, and what impact it has had to date using only publicly available data. The paper proceeds with analysis of the level of transparency and accountability to the people and communities affected by the disaster, rather than to foreign donors. This analysis shows relatively high transparency of financial flows during the response phase, but low transparency in the recovery phase. Furthermore, there is little evidence of accountability to affected populations through the transparency of information about the impact of the aid provided following TC Pam. This paper concludes with some recommendations to increase financial transparency and broader accountability following disasters.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Health research is important for the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. However, there are many challenges facing health research, including securing sufficient funds, building capacity, producing research findings and using both local and global evidence, and avoiding waste. A WHO initiative addressed these challenges by developing a conceptual framework with four functions to guide the development of national health research systems. Despite some progress, more is needed before health research systems can meet their full potential of improving health systems. The WHO Regional Office for Europe commissioned an evidence synthesis of the systems-level literature. This Opinion piece considers its findings before reflecting on the vast additional~literature available~on the range of specific health research system functions related to the various challenges. Finally, it considers who should lead research system strengthening. MAIN TEXT: The evidence synthesis identifies two main approaches for strengthening national health research systems, namely implementing comprehensive and coherent strategies and participation in partnerships. The literature describing these approaches at the systems level also provides data on ways to strengthen each of the four functions of governance, securing financing, capacity-building, and production and use of research. Countries effectively implementing strategies include England, Ireland and Rwanda, whereas West Africa experienced effective partnerships. Recommended policy approaches for system strengthening are context specific. The vast literature on each function and the ever-growing evidence-base are illustrated by considering papers in just one key journal, Health Research Policy and Systems, and analysing the contribution of two national studies. A review of the functions of the Iranian system identifies over 200 relevant and mostly national records; an analysis of the creation of the English National Institute for Health Research describes the key leadership role played by the health department. Furthermore, WHO is playing leadership roles in helping coordinate partnerships within and across health research systems that have been attempting to tackle the COVID-19 crisis. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence synthesis provides a firm basis for decision-making by policy-makers and research leaders looking to strengthen national health research systems within their own national context. It identifies five crucial policy approaches - conducting situation analysis, sustaining a comprehensive strategy, engaging stakeholders, evaluating impacts on health systems, and partnership participation. The vast and ever-growing additional literature could provide further perspectives, including on crucial leadership roles for health ministries.},

  abstract = {An analysis of glossaries of definitions from the grey literature revealed no universally accepted definition for migrant at an international level, with definitions varying by length of stay in a country, documentation/residency or reason for migration. The IOM has acknowledged that no universally accepted definition exists and has stated that â€œthe term migrant was usually understood to cover all cases where the decision to migrate was taken freely by the individual concerned for reasons of â€˜personal convenienceâ€™ and without intervention of an external compelling factorâ€ (168). Within organizations such as the United Nations, definitions have changed over time. In 1953, the United Nations Recommendations on statistics of international migration defined permanent immigrants as â€œnon-residents (both nationals and aliens) arriving with the intention to remain for a period exceeding one yearâ€; the revised Recommendations in 1998 removed the reference to length of stay and defined an international migrant as â€œany person who changes his/her country of usual residenceâ€ (172). The word alien, meaning not a citizen, is commonly used in national legislation dealing with citizenship and residence (e.g. the 1935 Alien Act in Ireland or more recently the 1998 Alien Act in Estonia). The UNHCR distinguishes between the causes of migration and refers to migrants only in the context of those who choose to move and are not forced to move because of a direct threat of persecution or death (170,173). At a European level, the European Migration Network (EMN) (see Case study 1) refers to residency and length of stay, defining a migrant in the EU context either as someone who establishes their usual residence in an EU Member State for at least 12 months, having previously been usually resident in another Member State or non-EU country, or as someone having previously been usually resident in a Member State who ceases to have their usual residence in that State for a period of at least 12 months (171).},

RMB internationalization might appear to provide a way out, but the policy has its limits and tends to exacerbate rather than relieve tensions. We argue that a tension-reducing solution is at hand to the problems of both the international monetary system and China\&mdash;IMF-style Special Drawing Rights (SDRs). If in a unilateral initiative China were to make the SDR central to its next phase of capital account opening, China\&rsquo;s institutions, corporates and individuals\&mdash;presently restricted in their access to international currency\&mdash;would likely embrace it. Begun by China, with support from the international community and Hong Kong, promulgation of the SDR would usher in an era of lower tensions, providing space for development and avoidance of conflict within a reordered monetary system in which China would have a more prominent role.},

The present study is the first to investigate the psychosocial determinants of CLTS in a longitudinal design. Furthermore, we tested whether CLTS can be made more effective by theory- and evidence-based interventions using the risks, attitudes, norms, abilities, and selfregulation (RANAS) model. Methods A cluster-randomized controlled trial of 3216 households was implemented in rural Ghana. Communities were randomly assigned to classic CLTS, one of three RANAS-based interventions, or to the control arm. Prepost surveys at 6-month follow-up included standardized interviews assessing psychosocial determinants from the RANAS model. Regression analyses and multilevel mediation models were computed to test intervention effects and mechanisms of CLTS. Results Latrine coverage increased pre-post by 67.6\% in all intervention arms and by 7.9\% in the control arm (p~{$<~$}.001). The combination with RANAS-based interventions showed non-significantly greater effects than CLTS alone. The effects of CLTS on latrine construction were significantly mediated by changes in four determinants: others' behaviour and approval, self-efficacy, action planning and commitment. Changes in vulnerability, severity, and barrier planning were positively connected to latrine construction but not affected by CLTS. Conclusion This study corroborates the effectiveness of CLTS in increasing latrine coverage, and additional activities can be improved further. Behaviour change techniques within CLTS that strengthened the relevant factors should be maintained. The study also recommends interventions based on the RANAS approach to improve CLTS. Further research is needed to understand the effects of RANAS-based interventions combined with CLTS at longer follow-up},

But, it is argued here, in psychology and American society at large, ethnicity seemingly has no real meaning apart from its status as a proxy for racial classification or immigrant status, while race has a clear meaning. Drawing on a cursory review of psychology abstracts, it is suggested that it is ill-advised to subsume the better known and more specifically defined construct under the rubric of the fuzzier construct.

Two key claims underpin this narrative: that global poverty has been cut in half, and global hunger nearly in half, since 1990. This good-news narrative has been touted by the United Nations and has been widely repeated by the media. But closer inspection reveals that the UNâ€™s claims about poverty and hunger are misleading, and even intentionally inaccurate. The MDGs have used targeted statistical manipulation to make it seem as though the poverty and hunger trends have been improving when in fact they have worsened. In addition, the MDGs use definitions of poverty and hunger that dramatically underestimate the scale likely of these problems. In reality, around four billion people remain in poverty today, and around two billion remain hungry â€“ more than ever before in history, and between two and four times what the UN would have us believe. The implications of this reality are profound. Worsening poverty and hunger trends indicate that our present model of development is not working and needs to be fundamentally rethought.},

For the thoughtful undergraduate or graduate student interested in understanding the complex political, social, and environmental drivers of health disparities worldwide, this is for you. In fact, this insightful, well-researched, comprehensive textbook should be required reading for anyone working in global health. The authors, renowned scholars and practitioners, cover a range of material from the local to the international level in low- and high-income countries alike. The first section covers the history of the field (commenting on significant events, policies, and other factors that have shaped health over the years), dominant ideologies, key governmental and nongovernmental organizations, measures and patterns of disease, and social determinants of health. The next section focuses on health economics, a comparison of healthcare systems in different countries, and the impact of crisis conditions (eg, war, terrorism) and environmental changes on health. The final chapters address ethical considerations for global health work and a way forward for the field.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Poor governance impedes the provision of equitable and cost-effective health care in many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Although systemic problems such as corruption and inefficiency have been characterized as intractable, "good governance" interventions that promote transparency, accountability and public participation have yielded encouraging results. Mobile phones and other Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) are beginning to play a role in these interventions, but little is known about their use and effects in the context of LMIC health care. METHODS: Multi-stage scoping review: Research questions and scope were refined through a landscape scan of relevant implementation activities and by analyzing related concepts in the literature. Relevant studies were identified through iterative Internet searches (Google, Google Scholar), a systematic search of academic databases (PubMed, Web of Science), social media crowdsourcing (targeted LinkedIn and Twitter appeals) and reading reference lists and websites of relevant organizations. Parallel expert interviews helped to verify concepts and emerging findings and identified additional studies for inclusion. Results were charted, analyzed thematically and summarized. RESULTS: We identified 34 articles from a wide range of disciplines and sectors, including 17 published research articles and 17 grey literature reports. Analysis of these articles revealed 15 distinct ways of using ICTs for good governance activities in LMIC health care. These use cases clustered into four conceptual categories: 1) gathering and verifying information on services to improve transparency and auditability 2) aggregating and visualizing data to aid communication and decision making 3) mobilizing citizens in reporting poor practices to improve accountability and quality and 4) automating and auditing processes to prevent fraud. Despite a considerable amount of implementation activity, we identified little formal evaluative research. CONCLUSION: Innovative digital approaches are increasingly being used to facilitate good governance in the health sectors of LMICs but evidence of their effectiveness is still limited. More empirical studies are needed to measure concrete impacts, document mechanisms of action, and elucidate the political and sociotechnical dynamics that make designing and implementing ICTs for good governance so complex. Many digital good governance interventions are driven by an assumption that transparency alone will effect change; however responsive feedback mechanisms are also likely to be necessary.},

Using a mixed-methods approach, we examine the impact of the Aid Transparency Index (ATI), an annual rating and rankings index produced by the small UK-based NGO Publish What You Fund. The ATI seeks to shape development aid donors' behavior with respect to their transparencyâ€”the quality and kind of information they publicly disclose. To investigate the ATI's effect, we construct an original panel data set of donor transparency performance before and after ATI inclusion (2006â€“2013) to test whether (and which) donors alter their behavior in response to inclusion in the ATI. To further probe the causal mechanisms that explain variations in donor behavior we use qualitative research, including over 150 key informant interviews conducted between 2010 and 2017. Our analysis uncovers the conditions under which the ATI influences powerful aid donors. Our mixed-methods evidence reveals how this happens. Consistent with Kelley and Simmons's central argument that GPIs exercise influence via social pressure, we find that the ATI shapes donor behavior primarily via direct effects on elites: the diffusion of professional norms, organizational learning, and peer pressure.},

In broad terms, the concept of sustainable development is an attempt to combine growing concerns about a range of environmental issues with socio-economic issues. To aid understanding of these different policies this paper presents a classification and mapping of different trends of thought on sustainable development, their political and policy frameworks and their attitudes towards change and means of change. Sustainable development has the potential to address fundamental challenges for humanity, now and into the future. However, to do this, it needs more clarity of meaning, concentrating on sustainable livelihoods and well-being rather than well-having, and long term environmental sustainability, which requires a strong basis in principles that link the social and environmental to human equity.

  abstract = {The SARS epidemic was not simply a public health problem. Indeed, it caused the most severe socio-political crisis for the Chinese leadership since the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown. Outbreak of the disease fueled fears among economists that Chinaâ€™s economy was headed for a serious downturn. A fatal period of hesitation regarding information-sharing and action spawned anxiety, panic, and rumor-mongering across the country and undermined the governmentâ€™s efforts to create a milder image of itself in the international arena. As Premier Wen Jiabao pointed out in a cabinet meeting on the epidemic, â€œthe health and security of the people, overall state of reform, development, and stability, and Chinaâ€™s national interest and international image are at stake (Zhongguo xinwen wang, 2003a).â€ In the weeks that followed, the Chinese government launched a crusade against SARS, effectively bringing the disease under control in late June and eliminating all known cases by mid-August.},

Despite the limited knowledge available it is clear that hundreds of millions of people are chronically poor, the causes are multifarious but can be analyzed through livelihoods frameworks and that the scale and nature of chronic poverty will require an increase in the levels of financing allocated to social protection in developing countries. Recent conceptual and methodological advances, and the increasing availability of panel datasets, mean that the analysis of deprivation can move on from poverty trends to poverty dynamics.},

Production processes increasingly involve a sequential, vertical trading chain stretching across many countries, with each country specializing in particular stages of a goodâ€™s production sequence. We document a key aspect of these vertical linkages â€” the use of imported inputs in producing goods that are exported â€” which we call vertical specialization. Using inputâ€“output tables from 10 OECD and four emerging market countries we calculate that vertical specialization accounts for 21\% of these countriesâ€™ exports, and grew almost 30\% between 1970 and 1990. We also find that growth in vertical specialization accounts for 30\% of the growth in these countriesâ€™ exports.},

How has this sudden increase in development resources affected the two major multilateral development banks (MDBs) in the region, the World Bank and the African Development Bank (AfDB)? One might expect that the MDBs would compete with China to maintain influence in Africa. This study uses statistical tests and interviews with government officials in three recipient countries to see if this is the case. The results indicate that total MDB finance by country change little over time in response to Chinese activity. The sectoral allocation of concessional lending to the poorer countries does not show any responsiveness either. In contrast, shifts in levels and sector allocation can be observed for non-concessional countries. Overall, the study suggests that while Chinaâ€™s role in African development finance is indeed substantial and growing, it has not had the â€œgame changingâ€ impact on traditional development finance as popular perception might lead one to believe. This may change, however, once more recipient countries develop economically and move to non-concessional lending.},

The cumulative economic freedom index show us how open and business friendly a country is. The sub-indices show us openness across different sector of the economy, for example, the financial sector or the trade sector etc. Traditional neo-classical economic theories have explained economic growth looking at the supply of labor, capital and state of technology, with little attention being paid to institutional factors. The study presents evidence based on two panel data-sets. The first set consists of 186 countries over the period 2013, 2014 and 2015 that show institutional factors play a crucial role in economic growth. A second data-set with data for 57 countries for the period 2004â€“2014 also show a positive impact on the index on the growth rate of per capita GDP.},

We find two interesting results over the study period ranging from December 1993 to July 2019. First, there exists asymmetric spillovers and connectedness among the considered exchange rates when trade policy uncertainty is present. Second, the volatility spillover is stronger than the return connectedness between exchange rate and trade policy uncertainty. These findings are robust to the presence of economic policy uncertainty effects. Concomitantly, the trade policy uncertainty patterns are also found to be useful for predicting currency market dynamics. Our findings contribute to the debate on the impact of trade policy uncertainty on the global economy and financial sector.},

  abstract = {Since the COVID-19 outbreak was first diagnosed, it has spread to over 200 countries and all U.S. states. The pandemic is negatively affecting global economic growth beyond anything experienced in nearly a century. Estimates so far indicate the virus could trim global economic growth by 3.0\% to 6.0\% in 2020, with a partial recovery in 2021, assuming there is not a second wave of infections. The economic fallout from the pandemic raises the risks of a global economic recession with levels of unemployment not experienced since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The human costs in terms of lives lost will permanently affect global economic growth in addition to the cost of rising levels of poverty, lives upended, careers derailed, and increased social unrest. Global trade could also fall by 18\%, depending on the depth and extent of the global economic downturn, exacting an especially heavy economic toll on trade-dependent developing and emerging economies. The full impact will not be known until the effects of the pandemic peak. This report provides an overview of the global economic costs to date and the response by governments and international institutions to address these effects.},

  abstract = {Objective To compare administrative coverage data with results from household coverage surveys for vitamin A supplementation (VAS) and deworming campaigns conducted during 2010â€“2015 in 12 African countries. Methods Paired t-tests examined differences between administrative and survey coverage for 52 VAS and 34 deworming dyads. Independent t-tests measured VAS and deworming coverage differences between data sources for door-to-door and fixed-site delivery strategies and VAS coverage differences between 6- to 11-month and 12- to 59-month age group. Results For VAS, administrative coverage was higher than survey estimates in 47 of 52 (90\%) campaign rounds, with a mean difference of 16.1\% (95\% CI: 9.5â€“22.7; P {$<$} 0.001). For deworming, administrative coverage exceeded survey estimates in 31 of 34 (91\%) comparisons, with a mean difference of 29.8\% (95\% CI: 16.9â€“42.6; P {$<$} 0.001). Mean Â± SD differences in coverage between administrative and survey data were 12.2\% Â± 22.5\% for the door-to-door delivery strategy and 25.9\% Â± 24.7\% for the fixed-site model (P = 0.06). For deworming, mean Â± SD differences in coverage between data sources were 28.1\% Â± 43.5\% and 33.1\% Â± 17.9\% for door-to-door and fixed-site distribution, respectively (P = 0.64). VAS administrative coverage was higher than survey estimates in 37 of 49 (76\%) comparisons for the 6- to 11-month age group and 45 of 48 (94\%) comparisons for the 12- to 59-month age group. Conclusion Reliance on health facility data alone for calculating VAS and deworming coverage may mask low coverage and prevent measures to improve programmes. Countries should periodically validate administrative coverage estimates with population-based methods.},

It then explores a number of new financial instruments and their possible impact on the future shape multilateralism takes in the UN system. The article concludes with some thoughts on financing for a new multilateralism. In order to go beyond the core/non-core stalemate, it is necessary to develop a new variable geometry based on function, which brings into play assessed, negotiated pledges, voluntary core and non-core instruments.},

  abstract = {The UN High Level Panel has called for a data revolution. The worldâ€™s population should be counted, measured, weighed, and evaluated. This information should be collected, compiled, aggregated, and presented in such a form that it can usefully inform policy-makers and citizens in aggregated forms, and disaggregated according to region, village, gender, and population group. It is tempting to think that having more and better information will improve policy choices, but this is not automatic. Moreover, demanding more information may lead to a deteriorating supply of information if demand outstrips supply. This article therefore focuses on the cost of the data revolution rather than its possible benefits. The simple starting point is that data do have a cost. The cost of the data revolution will be considerable. The costs include the sheer financial cost of monitoring, but importantly extend to include the opportunity cost of competing demands on survey capacity. Particular indicators also influence behavior by skewing activities in favor of completing goals with quantifiable targets. More data are only better data if they contain meaningful information that clearly outweighs the opportunity cost related to its gathering. However, funding available for sustainable development goal (SDG) measurement is limited and there are also institutional capacity limits to be reckoned with. On 11 March 2016, the United Nations Statistical Commissionâ€™s Interagency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs) agreed on 230 individual indicators to monitor the 17 goals and 169 targets. Because the final list of 230 indicators has been a moving target, the research for this article took as the starting point of what a reasonable level of measurement of the millennium development goals would have cost to raise a debate and to give a crude estimate over the cost of the introduction of the SDGs, with their exponential increased demand for data. This is done by bringing together and reconciles the existing information on the costs measurement as a reference for scholars concerned with SDG feasibility and operationalization.},

  abstract = {The appropriate measurement of food security is critical for targeting food and economic aid; supporting early famine warning and global monitoring systems; evaluating nutrition, health, and development programs; and informing government policy across many sectors. This important work is complicated by the multiple approaches and tools for assessing food security. In response, we have prepared a compendium and review of food security assessment tools in which we review issues of terminology, measurement, and validation. We begin by describing the evolving definition of food security and use this discussion to frame a review of the current landscape of measurement tools available for assessing food security. We critically assess the purpose/s of these tools, the domains of food security assessed by each, the conceptualizations of food security that underpin each metric, as well as the approaches that have been used to validate these metrics. Specifically, we describe measurement tools that 1) provide national-level estimates of food security, 2) inform global monitoring and early warning systems, 3) assess household food access and acquisition, and 4) measure food consumption and utilization. After describing a number of outstanding measurement challenges that might be addressed in future research, we conclude by offering suggestions to guide the selection of appropriate food security metrics.},

We consider a model where firms differ in their productivity and workers are differentiated by skill as well as gender. A reduction in tariffs induces more productive firms to modernize their technology and enter the export market. New technologies involve computerized production processes and lower the need for physically demanding skills. As a result, the relative wage and employment of women improves in blue-collar tasks, but not in white-collar tasks. We test our model using a panel of establishment level data from Mexico exploiting tariff reductions associated with the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Consistent with our theory we find that tariff reductions caused new firms to enter the export market, update their technology and replace male blue-collar workers with female blue-collar workers.},

Contemporary trade agreements, however, often reach beyond trade in the narrow sense. Consequently, factors unrelated to free trade may affect citizensâ€™ evaluations of these agreements. We propose a model of attitude formation toward specific trade agreements that includes the societal context as a constitutive feature. We expect salient aspects of an agreement to activate corresponding predispositions. Empirically, we compare how this contextual model and a standard model perform in explaining German citizensâ€™ attitudes toward free trade and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). The results show that the standard model performs well in explaining public opinion on the principle of free trade but is less useful in explaining attitudes toward TTIP. The latter were driven by postures toward transatlantic cooperation, predispositions toward the role of interest groups in politics, and market regulation â€“ aspects salient in German public discourse about TTIP. In sum, we find ample evidence for the need to differentiate between the two attitude objects and for our contextual model of attitude formation.},

  abstract = {This paper begins from the understanding that women's empowerment is about the process by which those who have been denied the ability to make strategic life choices acquire such an ability. A wide gap separates this processual understanding of empowerment from the more instrumentalist forms of advocacy which have required the measurement and quantification of empowerment. The ability to exercise choice incorporates three interrelated dimensions: resources (defined broadly to include not only access, but also future claims, to both material and human and social resources); agency (including processes of decision making, as well as less measurable manifestations of agency such as negotiation, deception and manipulation); and achievements (well-being outcomes). A number of studies of women's empowerment are analysed to make some important methodological points about the measurement of empowerment. The paper argues that these three dimensions of choice are indivisible in determining the meaning of an indicator and hence its validity as a measure of empowerment. The notion of choice is further qualified by referring to the conditions of choice, its content and consequences. These qualifications represent an attempt to incorporate the structural parameters of individual choice in the analysis of women's empowerment.},

  abstract = {A detailed examination of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals and the shift in governance strategy they represent. In September 2015, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Sustainable Development Goals as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The Sustainable Development Goals built on and broadened the earlier Millennium Development Goals, but they also signaled a larger shift in governance strategies. The seventeen goals add detailed content to the concept of sustainable development, identify specific targets for each goal, and help frame a broader, more coherent, and transformative 2030 agenda. The Sustainable Development Goals aim to build a universal, integrated framework for action that reflects the economic, social, and planetary complexities of the twenty-first century. This book examines in detail the core characteristics of goal setting, asking when it is an appropriate governance strategy and how it differs from other approaches; analyzes the conditions under which a goal-oriented agenda can enable progress toward desired ends; and considers the practical challenges in implementation.

This paper examines the impact of trade openness on economic growth for Cote dâ€™Ivoire over the period 1965â€“2014 in a multivariate framework including capital stock, labor and trade openness as regressors. It uses the Autoregressive Distributed Lag bounds test to cointegration and the Toda and Yamamoto Granger causality tests. The results show that trade openness has positive effects on economic growth both in the short and long run. Furthermore, they reveal a positive and strong complementary relationship between trade openness and capital formation in promoting economic growth.},

In this paper, we create a framework that specifies the conditions that affect whether passive representation results in active representation for sex and then test this framework using the case of education. We find that passive representation of women in education leads to active representation and that the institutional context affects the extent to which this link between passive and active representation occurs.},

Many of these new indicators are short-lived efforts to grab attention and are unlikely to matter much. But we believe there are good reasons to think that some GPIs affect important areas of state policy. Indeed, we argue that GPIs should be thought of increasingly as tools of global governance, involving rule-making and the exercise of soft power on a global scale and that their proliferation constitutes a profound social trend with implications for governance world-wide and reflects the diversity of actors and institutions attempting to influence policies across and among states. This article defines what we mean by global performance indicators, and describes their features. Using a new dataset and a series of interviews with producers of various indices, we document the proliferation of GPIs, which have been developed and promulgated by a wide range of actors, both public and private; unilaterally and multilaterally. We then elaborate possible causal mechanisms that we expect to connect externally generated GPIs with state policy, and hypothesize about the scope conditions for their effects.},

Systematic monitoring allows for the creation of numerical indicators that can be used to rank, compare, and essentially censure states. This article argues that the ability to disseminate such numerical indicators widely and instantly constitutes an exercise of social power, with the potential to change important policy outputs. It explores this argument in the context of the United Statesâ€™ efforts to combat trafficking in persons and find evidence that monitoring has important effects: Countries are more likely to criminalize human trafficking when they are included in the U.S. annual Trafficking in Persons Report, and countries that are placed on a â€œwatch listâ€ are also more likely to criminalize. These findings have broad implications for international governance and the exercise of soft power in the global information age.},

From the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Index to the Financial Action Task Force blacklist, global performance indicators (GPIs) are increasingly deployed to influence governance globally. We argue that GPIs derive influence from their ability to frame issues, extend the authority of the creator, and â€” most importantly â€” to invoke recurrent comparison that stimulates governments' concerns for their own and their country's reputation. Their public and ongoing ratings and rankings of states are particularly adept at capturing attention not only at elite policy levels but also among other domestic and transnational actors. GPIs thus raise new questions for research on politics and governance globally. What are the social and political effects of this form of information on discourse, policies and behavior? What types of actors can effectively wield GPIs and on what types of issues? In this symposium introduction, we define GPIs, describe their rise, and theorize and discuss these questions in light of the findings of the symposium contributions.},

Studies have consistently relied on settings, such as education, where quantitative data are easily accessible. Although these studies provide great insight, the findings may not translate into other policy settings. The concept of role perception allows expansion of representative bureaucracy studies into a variety of settings. Using Q-sort analysis, this project explores bureaucratic role perception, focusing on how bureaucrats see their role as representatives and on the effects of descriptive representation and organizational setting. Four perspectives on representative bureaucracy are identified: leaders, traditional bureaucrats, identity empathizers, and diversity advocates. These perspectives reflect Pitkinâ€™s discussion of representation and provide a more nuanced view of how bureaucrats see their roles. The findings suggest that (1) substantive representation may not require descriptive representation, (2) characteristics other than race and gender may be important, and (3) organizational variables may be related to bureaucratsâ€™ role perceptions. These findings illuminate future theoretical and empirical research possibilities},

We focus on the political-economic determinants of global health inequities, and how these determinants operate at different levels of social action (micro, meso, and macro) through distinct but interacting mechanisms. To clarify how these mechanisms operate, we develop an integrative framework for examining the links between global neoliberalismâ€”the currently dominant policy paradigm premised on advancing the reach of markets and promoting ever-growing international economic integrationâ€”and global health inequities, and show how these mechanisms have macroâ€“macro, macroâ€“mesoâ€“macro, and macroâ€“microâ€“macro manifestations. Our approach enables the design of theoretically-nuanced empirical strategies to document the multiple ways in which the political economy entrenches or, alternatively, might ameliorate global health inequities.},

A number of sociodemographic correlates of major depression are found consistently across countries, and cross-national data also document associations with numerous adverse outcomes, including difficulties in role transitions (e.g., low education, high teen childbearing, marital disruption, unstable employment), reduced role functioning (e.g., low marital quality, low work performance, low earnings), elevated risk of onset, persistence and severity of a wide range of secondary disorders, and increased risk of early mortality due to physical disorders and suicide.},

This article takes stock of the first 25+ years of adaptation finance under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and seeks to understand whether adaptation finance has become more justly governed and delivered over the past quarter century. We distinguish among three â€œerasâ€ of adaptation finance: (1) the early years under the UNFCCC (1992â€“2008); (2) the Copenhagen shift (2009â€“2015); and (3) the post-Paris era (2016â€“2018). For each era, we systematically review the justice issues raised by evolving expectations and rules over the provision, distribution, and governance of adaptation finance. We conclude by outlining future perspectives for adaptation finance and their implications for climate justice.},

Our results spanning 88 countries over 1960â€“2005 show that a positive long-run relationship between trade openness and financial development coexists with a negative short-run relationship. But when splitting the data into different income or inflation groups, this finding is observed only in relatively low-income countries or high-inflation economies.},

  abstract = {Background Gambia is the second GAVI support-eligible country to introduce the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7), but a country-specific cost-effectiveness analysis of the vaccine is not available. Our objective was to assess the potential impact of PCVs of different valences in The Gambia. Methods We synthesized the best available epidemiological and cost data using a state-transition model to simulate the natural histories of various pneumococcal diseases. For the base-case, we estimated incremental cost (in 2005 US dollars) per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted under routine vaccination using PCV9 compared to no vaccination. We extended the base-case results for PCV9 to estimate the cost-effectiveness of PCV7, PCV10, and PCV13, each compared to no vaccination. To explore parameter uncertainty, we performed both deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. We also explored the impact of vaccine efficacy waning, herd immunity, and serotype replacement, as a part of the uncertainty analyses, by assuming alternative scenarios and extrapolating empirical results from different settings. Results Assuming 90\% coverage, a program using a 9-valent PCV (PCV9) would prevent approximately 630 hospitalizations, 40 deaths, and 1000 DALYs, over the first 5 years of life of a birth cohort. Under base-case assumptions (\$3.5 per vaccine), compared to no intervention, a PCV9 vaccination program would cost \$670 per DALY averted in The Gambia. The corresponding values for PCV7, PCV10, and PCV13 were \$910, \$670, and \$570 per DALY averted, respectively. Sensitivity analyses that explored the implications of the uncertain key parameters showed that model outcomes were most sensitive to vaccine price per dose, discount rate, case-fatality rate of primary endpoint pneumonia, and vaccine efficacy against primary endpoint pneumonia. Conclusions Based on the information available now, infant PCV vaccination would be expected to reduce pneumococcal diseases caused by S. pneumoniae in The Gambia. Assuming a cost-effectiveness threshold of three times GDP per capita, all PCVs examined would be cost-effective at the tentative Advance Market Commitment (AMC) price of \$3.5 per dose. Because the cost-effectiveness of a PCV program could be affected by potential serotype replacement or herd immunity effects that may not be known until after a large scale introduction, type-specific surveillance and iterative evaluation will be critical.},

We establish a country-level panel data set including CO2 emissions, gross domestic product (GDP), and other socioeconomic data for 1997â€“2008 and 2005â€“2008. Based on the impact evaluation, we conduct the simulation predicting the impacts of the Protocol to capture the differences of marginal damage cost of carbon emissions between the actual and counterfactual situations. The results suggest that participating as an Annex I party has a significant positive impact on CO2 emission reductions, but a negative impact on the GDP of the participants in the long run. The predicted marginal benefit of the Protocol based on the marginal damage cost of carbon emissions shows that the marginal benefit of emission reductions mitigates a limited portion of the GDP loss. Future global climate change frameworks should focus on balancing the impact on economic and environmental performance in order to ensure sustainable development, especially for developing countries that have low capacity to mitigate emissions.},

  abstract = {The Group of Seven (G7) Finance Ministers forum and now Group of Eight (G8) Summit was created as a high capacity institution to deliberate, take decisions, deliver them, and develop global governance in response to the cascading financial and other crisis starting in the 1970â€™s. It was also created to diffuse globally its core principles of â€œopen democracy, individual liberty and social advancement.â€ The changes brought by globalization, notably a succession of financial crises since 1994 and the terrorist shocks since September 11, 2001, have catalyzed the development since 1999 of a broader, more collectively capable Group of Twenty (G20) to help provide global governance in finance and related fields. The G20â€™s expanded number and range of systemically important countries as members increases the capacity, representativeness and resulting legitimacy of this new centre of collective leadership. But with non-democratic China and Saudi Arabia as members, and stability, growth and equity as core principles, to what extent can the G20 help globally diffuse the democratic norms its G8 members share? An analysis of the G20â€™s performance since its 1999 start suggests that the G20 has done much to adopt and diffuse democratic norms. The vulnerability and shocks bred by globalization shared by both members substantially helps explains this trend, as does the deepening institutionalization of the G20 as a balanced, autonomous, valued forum led by experienced hosts during the more shock free years since 2001. The strong G20 performance in democracy diffusion as well as in its deliberative, decisional and development of global governance functions sustains the case for elevating the G20 to a leaders level L20, for doing this deliberately rather than waiting for a new galvanizing shock, and for using the well performing G20 itself, rather than existing G8 or UN Summits as the institutional nest to give the L20 its birth.},

This study extends this work by adjusting the recommendations, making concrete proposals for two gender-related indicators, and presenting illustrative results for these proposed measures.

The study also proposes and implements several modifications and simplifications to the GEM. With these adjustments, a number of Sub-Saharan countries now rank much higher, countries in the Middle East have lower scores in both measures, and some European countries fare notably worse in the revised GEM.},

This paper provides an overview of the USDG and explores some of the difficulties around using this goal as a tool for improving cities. We argue that challenges emerge around selecting the indicators in the first place and also around the practical use of these indicators once selected. Three main practical problems of indicator use include 1) the poor availability of standardized, open and comparable data 2) the lack of strong data collection institutions at the city scale to support monitoring for the USDG and 3) â€œlocalizationâ€ - the uptake and context specific application of the goal by diverse actors in widely different cities. Adding to the complexity, the USDG conversation is taking place at the same time as the proliferation of a bewildering array of indicator systems at different scales. Prompted by technological change, debates on the â€œdata revolutionâ€ and â€œsmart cityâ€ also have direct bearing on the USDG. We argue that despite these many complexities and challenges, the USDG framework has the potential to encourage and guide needed reforms in our cities but only if anchored in local institutions and initiatives informed by open, inclusive and contextually sensitive data collection and monitoring.},

  abstract = {This paper assesses corruption levels and trends among countries in the transition countries of Eastern Europe and Central Asia (ECA) based on data from several sources that are both widely used and cover most or all countries in the region. Data from firm surveys tend to show improvement in most types of administrative corruption, but little change instate capturein the region. Broader, subjective corruption indicators tend to show somewhat greater improvement in ECA than in non-ECA countries on average. A "primer on corruption indicators" discusses definitional and methodological differences among data sources that may account in large part for the apparently conflicting messages they often provide. This discussion concludes that depending on one's purpose, it may be more appropriate to use data from a single source rather than a composite index because of the loss of conceptual precision in aggregation. A second conclusion is that the gains in statistical precision from aggregating sources of corruption data likely are far more modest than often claimed because of interdependence among data sources. The range of detailed corruption measures available in firm surveys are exploited to show that broad, perceptions-based corruption assessments appear to measure primarily administrative corruption, despite their stated criteria placing great weight onstate capture. Finally, the paper emphasizes the need for scaling up data initiatives to fill significant gaps between our conceptual definitions of corruption and the operational definition embodied in the existing measures.},

Yet in some cases, the policy interventions adopted by the managers of these NGAs appear not to be welcomed by their supposed beneficiaries. This article accounts for this predicament by examining the effects of different configurations of accountability within NGAs promoting labor rights. Most labor-rights NGAs incorporate â€œproxy accountabilityâ€ arrangements, in which consumers and activists hold decision makers accountable â€œon behalfâ€ of the putative beneficiaries of the NGAs: workers and affected communities in poorer countries. The article shows how and why different combinations of proxy versus beneficiary accountability influence the choice of policy instruments used by NGAs, and applies the argument to three prominent non-state initiatives in the domain of labor standards.},

When asked to compose visualization titles, people used five existing news frames, an open-ended frame, and a statistics frame. We found that the slant of the title influenced the perceived main message of a visualization, with viewers deriving opposing messages from the same visualization. The results did not show any significant effect on attitude change. We highlight the danger of subtle statistics frames and viewers' unwarranted conviction of the neutrality of visualizations. Finally, we present a design implication for the generation of visualization titles and one for the viewing of titles.},

The first is the continuing legacy of colonial constructions and the persistence of forms of racial difference and hierarchy in development. The second concerns the power of whiteness and specifically how authority, expertise and knowledge become racially symbolized. The third area for further examination is how â€˜raceâ€™ is disguised through the use of specialized terminology and criteria in accounting for poverty and social exclusion. The paper concludes by suggesting that debates around multiculturalism and anti-racism could inform a shift away from racialized representations and inequalities prevailing in development.},

The present study focuses on a panel of 27 transition and 20 developed countries between 1990 and 2006 and uses the latest developments in panel unit root and cointegration techniques to disentangle the effects of international spillovers via inflows of trade and FDI on total factor productivity (TFP). The findings show that imports remain the main channel of diffusion for both sets of countries, while FDI, although statistically significant, has a lower impact on productivity of the recipients. The domestic R\&D capital stock plays an active role in Western Europe while in the Eastern part it is less significant owing to lower levels, transitional disinvestment and relative obsolescence. Human capital affects TFP directly as a factor of production as well as indirectly by enhancing a country's absorptive capacity. In aggregate, the results show that transition countries from Eastern Europe and Central Asia seem to enjoy bigger productivity gains from the international diffusion process than their Western counterparts.},

Opening up to trade results in the import of indivisibles and a fall in manufacturing wages, breaking this virtuous circle. Consequently, trade liberalization without structural reform can have serious adverse effects in a transition economy.},

  abstract = {Thirty years have passed since a small group of theorists began applying concepts and tools from industrial organization to the analysis of international trade. The new models of trade that emerged from that work didn't supplant traditional trade theory so much as supplement it, creating an integrated view that made sense of aspects of world trade that had previously posed major puzzles. The "new trade theory"â€”an unfortunate phrase, now quite often referred to as "the old new trade theory"â€”also helped build a bridge between the analysis of trade between countries and the location of production within countries. In this paper I will try to retrace the steps and, perhaps even more important, the state of mind that made this intellectual transformation possible. At the end I'll also ask about the relevance of those once-revolutionary insights in a world economy that, as I'll explain, is arguably more classical now than it was when the revolution in trade theory began.},

The official commitment to higher economic growth may reflect booming economic growth but it also has led to a large gap between the rich and the poor in both regional and social dimensions. To look into the causes and ameliorate poverty levels, various committees and policies have identified poverty levels. Using different criteria and methods, they still have failed to look at the social and political aspects. It is politics that has engulfed the whole discourse over universalisation of social welfare policies as some sort of justification behind the nationâ€™s fiscal deficit and subsidy constraint-related questions.},

Thereby, government institutions, international (financial) organisations, NGOs and private sector actors have become interested in migration and remittances and their potential for poverty reduction and development, and have started to devise institutions and policies to harness this potential.  This book employs a gender-sensitive governmentality analysis to trace the emergence of the GRT, to map its conceptual and institutional elements, and to examine its broader implications. Through an analysis of the GRT at the international level, combined with an in-depth case study on Mexico, this book demonstrates that the GRT is instrumental in spreading and deepening specific forms of gendered neoliberal governmentality.  This innovative book will be of interest to students and scholars of political science, international relations, sociology, development studies, economics, gender studies and Latin American studies.},

  abstract = {Although few disagree that advancements in technology and the establishment of trade-conducive transnational institutions play an important role in augmenting the potential for trade globalization, there is more disagreement surrounding alternative causal explanations of trade during the postwar period. While world-system scholars argue that international trade increases when a hegemonic nation-state is powerful enough to provide geopolitical stability and trade-conducive policies, world-polity theorists maintain that trade results from the emanation of â€œcultural scriptsâ€ that create compatible national institutions and trust among nation-states. This article tests these theories by analyzing a global-level data set with information from 1945 to 2005 via autoregressive integrated moving-average models. The results provide strong support for the world-system contention that increases in the power of the hegemonic nation-state amplify levels of trade globalization. Furthermore, although there is some support for the world-polity contention that the spread of democracy is positively associated with international trade, there is little evidence to validate the claim that the proliferation of intergovernmental organizations enhances trade globalization.},

In a new scenario analysis, we estimate that globally, absent interventions, 148 million people could fall into extreme poverty (measured against the PPP\$1.90 poverty line) in 2020â€”an increase of 20\% from present levels. This in turn would drive up food insecurity. A global health crisis could thus cause a major food crisisâ€”unless steps are taken to provide unprecedented economic emergency relief. Assessing the poverty impact of COVID-19 is not trivial, however. This is so not only because the crisis is still unfolding and available information of the precise socio-economic consequences is incomplete, but also because the channels of influence are multiple and interconnected globally. Furthermore, while a number of other analyses of the poverty impacts have assumed uniform shifts in the distribution of in-come per country, we are concerned that this assumption fails to take into account the complexity of the channels of effect. For these reasons, we use a global modelling framework to assess the potential impacts of the COVID-19 crisis on global poverty and food security. Specifically, we combine two economic modeling frameworks: the MIRAGRODEP global computable general equilibrium (CGE) model and the POVANA household dataset and model.

Although no major food shortages have emerged as yet, agricultural and food markets are facing disruptions because of labor shortages created by restrictions on movements of people and shifts in food demand resulting from closures of restaurants and schools as well as from income losses. Export restrictions imposed by some countries have disrupted trade flows for staple foods such as wheat and rice. The pandemic is affecting all four pillars of food security (1): availability (is the supply of food adequate?), access (can people obtain the food they need?), utilization (do people have enough intake of nutrients?), and stability (can people access food at all times?). COVID-19 is most directly and severely impacting access to food, even though impacts are also felt through disruptions to availability; shifts in consumer demand toward cheaper, less nutritious foods; and food price instability. We outline the main threats COVID-19 poses to food security and suggest critical responses that policy-makers should consider to prevent this global health crisis from becoming a global food crisis.},

Four approaches to the definition and measurement of poverty are reviewed in this paper: the monetary, capability, social exclusion and participatory approaches. The theoretical underpinnings of the various measures and problems of operationalizing them are pointed out. It is argued that each is a construction of reality, involving numerous judgements, which are often not transparent. The different methods have different implications for policy, and also, to the extent that they point to different people as being poor, for targeting. Empirical work in Peru and India shows that there is significant lack of overlap between the methods with, for example, nearly half the population identified as in poverty according to monetary poverty but not in capability poverty, and conversely. This confirms similar findings elsewhere. Hence, the definition of poverty does matter for poverty eradication strategies.},

The model builds on Fajgelbaum and Redding (2018) adding restrictions on internal mobility. We use this framework to identify which places are likely to gain and which places are likely to lose. The findings are that BRI transport investments favor development in larger urban districts near trade hubs, while people in more distant regions tend to lose out. Investments in trade facilitation are complementary policies that bring large additional welfare gains and can help in spatially spreading the benefits. However, barriers to internal labor mobility are likely to exacerbate wage inequalities while dampening overall welfare.},

This paper is the first empirical assessment of M\&E frameworks used by development cooperation agencies for projects and programmes with adaptation-specific or adaptation-related components. It analyses documents for 106 projects across 6 bilateral development agencies. The analysis finds that Result Based Management, the Logical Framework Approach and the accompanying logframe are the most common M\&E approaches used for adaptation. In applying these approaches, the long-term perspective of most adaptation initiatives means that it is particularly important to clearly differentiate between outcomes, outputs and activities. In addition, M\&E frameworks for adaptation should combine qualitative, quantitative and binary indicators. Baselines for these indicators should be specified to improve understanding of progress. Significant challenges remain in relation to dealing with shifting baselines, attribution and time lags between interventions and outcomes.},

Such an index makes it possible to rank countries and communities within countries taking into account both physical and socio-economic factors associated with water scarcity. This enables national and international organisations concerned with water provision and management to monitor both the resources available and the socioeconomic factors which impact on access and use of those resources. This paper presents details of the methodology used and the results obtained for 140 countries covering measures of resources, access, capacity, use and environment.},

  abstract = {Adaptation planning is crucial for cities and their communities to plan for and take actions to tackle climate change, the current greatest risk to human-being and ecosystem. Cities across many regions have benefited from the scholarship development of vulnerability, adaptation, and resilience. Reflective studies to track these planning practices, however, are scarce at the city level in developing countries. Especially while climate change poses an acute impact on the coastal cities of developing countries, there are no broad-scale comparative studies of municipal adaptation plans in this context. This dissertation, formatted into three papers, aims to fill three important gaps of municipal climate adaptation planning. The first paper seeks to unpack the state-of-the-art of adaptation planning in 45 coastal cities in developing countries, particularly focusing on understanding the types of vulnerability and exploring the planned adaptation options. Using content analysis on the planning documents, the study found that vulnerability in this local context is not only the climate change impacts, but more importantly, the sensitive socio-economic status, the insufficient infrastructure system, and limited capacity. Adaptation options, correspondingly, aim to address current vulnerabilities rather than climate change impacts. The second paper strikes to explore the relationship between vulnerability and adaptation. Using ANOVA and multiple regression analysis, this paper found an inconsistency between vulnerability level and the extent of adaptation responses but a significant relationship between exposure level and the number of institutional measures. This study also found a matter of city size while the vulnerability level is not statistically different between large and small cities, the capacity for adaptation is notably different with large cities tend to propose a significantly high number of adaptation initiatives. The third paper examines the influence of theoretical frameworks on the adaptation planning outcome. The finding shows a significant difference in planning outcome associated with the theoretical framework that guides the planning process. The vulnerability-based framework tackles the issues of climate change sufficiently with a relatively equal focus on structural, social, and institutional aspects. The hazard-based approach shares resources for both climate change and other matters and focuses prominently on structural measures. The urban resilience framework puts more efforts into other issues rather than climate change, with the most emphasis on social initiatives. Several important implications emerge from these findings. First, municipal climate change adaptation in developing countries cannot separate from socio-economic development and capacity building, and a coordination mechanism for inter-policy is necessary. Second, adaptation planning in cities needs to be more focused on vulnerabilities for better understanding their causes to take proper actions that account for potential climate change impacts and future needs. Third, institutional measures should be promoted to address rising exposure to coastal hazards and climate change. Fourth, planners should acknowledge the distinctive influence of theoretical frameworks on the formulation of adaptation options. The planning process, therefore, should apply a comprehensive vulnerability assessment to minimize the framing bias issue. Lastly, given the uncertainty and increasing impact of climate change, the large and small cities should receive equal attention and proportional resources to tackle this global issue.},

  abstract = {Existing research has increasingly identified synergies and trade-offs between urban climate change mitigation and adaptation policies. There is a gap, however, in our knowledge of the extent to which urban climate change mitigation efforts affect the adoption of adaptation policies. Analysing the presence of different levels of climate change mitigation efforts in European cities, while also considering local climate risks and national adaptation mandates, our results show a positive and significant correlation between mitigation and adaptation policies. This is partly a result of the perceptions and discourses linking global and local climate risks, and partly a consequence of the co-benefits of the two activities at the local level, which enable cities to piggyback on their prior mitigation efforts when adopting adaptation policies. A conceptual â€˜mitigation-adaptation nexusâ€™ governance framework is adopted to improve the current synergy versus conflict debate. Multilevel logit regression analyses of 261 European cities, controlling for both cityand country-level factors, suggest that adaptation is positively influenced in cities with mitigation action policies with monitoring systems, rather than mere mitigation commitments. We also find that national mandates drive local adoption of adaptation policies.},

Data are systematically collected from National Communications prepared by Parties to the Convention and submitted periodically to the Secretariat. 4,104 discrete adaptation initiatives are identified and analyzed. Our findings indicate that while progress is being made on conducting impact and vulnerability assessments and adaptation research in nearly every country in the sample, translation of this knowledge into tangible adaptation initiatives is still limited. The largest number of reported adaptations falls under the category of infrastructure, technology, and innovation. Some types of vulnerability were more frequently reported across initiatives, including floods, drought, food and water safety and security, rainfall, infectious disease, and terrestrial ecosystem health. Notably, reporting on the inclusion of vulnerable sub-populations is low across all actions. Diffusion of adaptation across sectors remains underdeveloped, with the environment, water, and agricultural sectors emerging as the most active adaptors. Our analysis indicates that national communications provide a valuable source of information for global-scale adaptation tracking, but important gaps exist in the consistency of reporting that should be addressed, as these documents could greatly enhance efforts to monitor and evaluate adaptation progress.},

Using a policy mixes approach to address this challenge, we characterize adaptation policy based on a general model of how governments govern issues of societal interest. We argue that this approach allows for context-sensitive measurement of adaptation policy, while being both comparable and parsimonious. This approach is tested in a study of adaptation policies adopted by 125 local governments located in Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and the UK. Using a systematic data collection protocol, a total of 3328 adaptation policies were identified from local council archives between the periods of January 2010 and May 2017. Results of this analysis suggest that there is structured variation emerging in how local governments govern climate change adaptation, which justifies calls for comparative adaptation research to use measurements that capture the totality of adaptation policies being adopted by governments rather than focusing on specific types of adaptation policy. We conclude with a discussion of key issues for further developing of this approach.},

However, our previous work has not taken different types of aid and different types of decentralization into account, which is at the heart of our current analysis. We consider different measures of decentralization, in particular measures of fiscal decentralization derived from government finance statistics and measures of political decentralization that are constructed based on countriesâ€™ constitutional rules. In addition, we take different types of aid into account: grants, loans, technical assistance, total net ODA; and we distinguish between multi-lateral and bi-lateral aid in order to consider differences in the donor structure. Our empirical analysis is based on panel data of up to 53 developing countries. In our growth regressions, we combine all types of decentralization with the different types of aid. We find important differences between different types of decentralization: (i) fiscal decentralization negatively affects aid effectiveness (in line with our previous work), (ii) employment decentralization may increase aid effectiveness, and (iii) political decentralization does not hamper aid effectiveness or may even have positive effects.},

This article attempts to provide some clues for a better understanding of this issue by examining China's views on and policy toward international multilateralism in general and some of the newly emerging multilateral mechanisms in particular, including the Group of 20 and the BRICS. The article concludes that while China will become more proactive in its multilateral diplomacy, in many cases selectively, and increase its influence in global multilateral settings, various concerns and constraints will make it unlikely for China to completely overhaul or even dramatically reshape the multilateral architecture at the global level. China is likely to repeat its pattern of the past decade in East Asian regional multilateralism: participation, engagement, pushing for cooperation in areas that would serve Chinese interests, avoiding excessive responsibilities, blocking initiatives that would harm its interests, and refraining from making grand proposals. In addition, China is stuck in defining its identity, and caught up between posturing as a leader of the developing world on some issues and siding with the developed countries on other policy issues. Given all of these constraints, China's involvement in global multilateralism is likely to be guided by pragmatism rather than grand visions. The article also argues that China will most likely strive to rise from within the existing international order. Washington should be prepared to plan its China policy on this basis and Sino-US relations will be shaped largely by the dynamics of contentions for power and interest as well as cooperation and coordination between China and the United States in various multilateral institutions.},

Given this exponential growth, it is essential to reflect on what we have done to house this growing populationâ€”or what residents have done to procure housing on their own. According to the numbers, we have been capable of building enough housing to compensate for the quantitative deficit; t he biggest challenge we face today is to how to make qualitative changes to the existing housing stock. Population growth continues to be strong in the emerging economies of the Global South, and exploring the potential of housing to transform the urban fabric is critical to building better cities.},

  abstract = {Global measurements have become foundational for understanding gender equality as well as for directing resources and policy development to address gendered inequalities. We argue in this article that attempts to quantify gender (in)equality globally have limited potential for successfully challenging gender hierarchies if compared to internationally agreed upon women's rights standards. To make this argument, we start by contrasting the general assumptions underlying the measurement approach with feminist scholarship on gender equality. Second, we examine nine key measures of global gender equality-the majority of which are produced by influential international organizations-and show that their focus on 'countability' perpetuates a narrow and misleading understanding of gender (in)equality. Third, we present the CEDAW Convention and associated review process as an alternative to the measurement approach. The comparison highlights the need for evaluative tools that attend to the complexity and fluidity of gender norms and focus on context-specific agency to confront gender hierarchies.},

  abstract = {The World Bankâ€™s Human Capital Index (HCI) aims to provide new information regarding future productivity of each countryâ€™s workforce, by synchronizing available International Large-Scale Assessment (ILSA) and regional test program results. Linking the literature on ILSA participation, this study questions the problematic nature of this approach and revisits the comparability issue of ILSA results. We find that education systems are imposed upon a score penalty depending on which ILSA or regional test program they choose to partake in. In particular, our results show that (i) test-overlap systems used in the score synchronization procedure are systematically different from systems that only choose to participate in one ILSA or exclusively in regional tests, (ii) inter-test score exchange rate is volatile due to sampling design and cohort effects, (iii) test participation type alone accounts for about 57.8 percent of the variation in synchronized scores, and the score penalty is especially salient for systems that exclusively participate in regional test programs; the majority of which are low-income and lower-middle income countries. Findings in this study show how various intra- and extrapolations to compensate for missing data in effect introduce large score penalties for systems that either did not participate or only partially participated in ILSAs. Finally, this study contributes to research on reasons for participation in ILSAs and the global rise of test-based accountability reform, under which the World Bankâ€™s new HCI may be seen as a tool to incentivize participation in ILSAs by penalizing those governments that have chosen alternative, non-standardized paths for measuring learning outcomes of students.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h2{$>$}Summary{$<$}/h2{$><$}h3{$>$}Background{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Achieving universal health coverage (UHC) involves all people receiving the health services they need, of high quality, without experiencing financial hardship. Making progress towards UHC is a policy priority for both countries and global institutions, as highlighted by the agenda of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and WHO's Thirteenth General Programme of Work (GPW13). Measuring effective coverage at the health-system level is important for understanding whether health services are aligned with countries' health profiles and are of sufficient quality to produce health gains for populations of all ages.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Methods{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Based on the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019, we assessed UHC effective coverage for 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2019. Drawing from a measurement framework developed through WHO's GPW13 consultation, we mapped 23 effective coverage indicators to a matrix representing health service types (eg, promotion, prevention, and treatment) and five population-age groups spanning from reproductive and newborn to older adults (â‰¥65 years). Effective coverage indicators were based on intervention coverage or outcome-based measures such as mortality-to-incidence ratios to approximate access to quality care; outcome-based measures were transformed to values on a scale of 0â€“100 based on the 2Â·5th and 97Â·5th percentile of location-year values. We constructed the UHC effective coverage index by weighting each effective coverage indicator relative to its associated potential health gains, as measured by disability-adjusted life-years for each location-year and population-age group. For three tests of validity (content, known-groups, and convergent), UHC effective coverage index performance was generally better than that of other UHC service coverage indices from WHO (ie, the current metric for SDG indicator 3.8.1 on UHC service coverage), the World Bank, and GBD 2017. We quantified frontiers of UHC effective coverage performance on the basis of pooled health spending per capita, representing UHC effective coverage index levels achieved in 2019 relative to country-level government health spending, prepaid private expenditures, and development assistance for health. To assess current trajectories towards the GPW13 UHC billion targetâ€”1 billion more people benefiting from UHC by 2023â€”we estimated additional population equivalents with UHC effective coverage from 2018 to 2023.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Findings{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Globally, performance on the UHC effective coverage index improved from 45Â·8 (95\% uncertainty interval 44Â·2â€“47Â·5) in 1990 to 60Â·3 (58Â·7â€“61Â·9) in 2019, yet country-level UHC effective coverage in 2019 still spanned from 95 or higher in Japan and Iceland to lower than 25 in Somalia and the Central African Republic. Since 2010, sub-Saharan Africa showed accelerated gains on the UHC effective coverage index (at an average increase of 2Â·6\% [1Â·9â€“3Â·3] per year up to 2019); by contrast, most other GBD super-regions had slowed rates of progress in 2010â€“2019 relative to 1990â€“2010. Many countries showed lagging performance on effective coverage indicators for non-communicable diseases relative to those for communicable diseases and maternal and child health, despite non-communicable diseases accounting for a greater proportion of potential health gains in 2019, suggesting that many health systems are not keeping pace with the rising non-communicable disease burden and associated population health needs. In 2019, the UHC effective coverage index was associated with pooled health spending per capita (\emph{r}=0Â·79), although countries across the development spectrum had much lower UHC effective coverage than is potentially achievable relative to their health spending. Under maximum efficiency of translating health spending into UHC effective coverage performance, countries would need to reach \$1398 pooled health spending per capita (US\$ adjusted for purchasing power parity) in order to achieve 80 on the UHC effective coverage index. From 2018 to 2023, an estimated 388Â·9 million (358Â·6â€“421Â·3) more population equivalents would have UHC effective coverage, falling well short of the GPW13 target of 1 billion more people benefiting from UHC during this time. Current projections point to an estimated 3Â·1 billion (3Â·0â€“3Â·2) population equivalents still lacking UHC effective coverage in 2023, with nearly a third (968Â·1 million [903Â·5â€“1040Â·3]) residing in south Asia.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Interpretation{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}The present study demonstrates the utility of measuring effective coverage and its role in supporting improved health outcomes for all peopleâ€”the ultimate goal of UHC and its achievement. Global ambitions to accelerate progress on UHC service coverage are increasingly unlikely unless concerted action on non-communicable diseases occurs and countries can better translate health spending into improved performance. Focusing on effective coverage and accounting for the world's evolving health needs lays the groundwork for better understanding how closeâ€”or how farâ€”all populations are in benefiting from UHC.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Funding{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Bill \& Melinda Gates Foundation.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

In this paper, we analyze the quality of databases for assessing progress by Sub-Saharan African countries towards meeting industry-related SDG targets. We find data quality issues least severe for two out of the five conventional economic indicators but extremely severe for the other three economic indicators, moderately severe for the one employment indicator, and extremely severe for the six environmental indicators except for energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. We also assess the feasibility of meeting conventional economic, employment, and energy targets by the year 2030 and find that they are overly optimistic for most countries. We propose setting additional and more realistic targets based on past country performance.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Indiscriminate violence against civilians has long been viewed as a catalyst for new rounds of violence in civil wars. Can humanitarian assistance reduce violence after civilians have been harmed? Crossnational studies are pessimistic, drawing a connection between humanitarian aid and increased civil war violence, lethality, and duration. To date, however, we have few subnational studies of wartime aid and subsequent violence. To examine this relationship, I draw on the Afghan Civilian Assistance Program (ACAP II), a USAID-funded initiative that investigated 1,061 civilian casualty incidents (2011â€“13). Aid was assigned as if randomly to about half (55.8\%) of these incidents, facilitating counterfactual estimation of how assistance affected Taliban attacks against the International Security Assistance Force, Afghan forces, and civilians. Challenging prior studies, I find that ACAP was associated with an average 23 percent reduction in attacks against ISAF, but not Afghan forces or civilians, at the village level for up to two years after the initial incident.},

Research on the influence of these variables on health outcomes in general, and cognitive test performance specifically, is presented. This research indicates that when variables such as quality of education, wealth, and perceived racism are taken into account, the effect of race/ethnicity on health outcomes is greatly reduced. In other words, race/ethnicity serves as a proxy for these more meaningful variables, and explicit measurement of these constructs will improve research of health within majority and minority ethnic groups.},

This study reviewed the existing literature to provide a better understanding of the evolution of Iran's health research system over this period. Methods: A narrative review of studies addressing health research system (HRS) in Iran was performed. The search strategy and categorization of the retrieved data was informed by the HRS framework of the World Health Organization (WHO). This framework proposes four functions for HRS: (i) stewardship; (ii) financing; (iii) creating and sustaining resources; and (iv) producing and using research. Searches in MEDLINE through PubMed (using MeSH terms) complemented with semantic searches through PubMed and Google Scholar were conducted. Results: After removing the duplicates, 805 articles were retrieved, of which 601 were irrelevant, and 204 were reviewed. Conclusions: Iran has made substantial progress in different components of its HRS over the last few decades, such as starting a discourse surrounding health research ethics, priority-setting, and placing monitoring mechanisms while increasing the capacity for conducting and publishing research. However, there is still room for improvements, or even a need for fundamental changes, in several components, such as regarding increasing the research budget and improving the funding allocation mechanisms; improving the education curriculum; and promoting the use of evidence. The findings emphasized that improvement of HRS functions requires addressing context-specific problems. This review provides essential lessons to share with other low- and middle-income countries and international organizations, eg, the WHO.},

More recently, a number of studies have used structured observations to study practices related to diarrhoea. During a trial of a hygiene education intervention to reduce diarrhoea among young children in Bandundu, Zaire, both instruments were used to measure the disposal of child faeces and various hand-washing practices. Three hundred families were observed and follow-up interviews performed with 274 (91\%) mothers. At the individual level, agreement between observed and reported behaviour was little better than might be expected by chance. There was evidence of over-reporting of hand-washing before food preparation (44\%vs 33\%; P= 0.03), hand-washing before eating (76\%vs 60\%; P {$<$} 0.001) and disposal of the childâ€™s faeces in a latrine (75\%vs 40\%; P {$<$} 0.001). On the other hand, hand-washing before feeding the child was reported less often than it was observed (7\%vs 64\%; P {$<$} 0.001). Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that, in general, mothers over-report â€˜desirableâ€™ behaviours. At the same time, our data indicate that open questions may lead to under-reporting of certain behaviours. The repeatability of observations at both the individual and population levels remains to be established.},

The Logistics Performance Index (LPI) analyses differences between countries in terms of customs procedures, logistics costs and the quality of the infrastructure for overland and maritime transport. The aim of this article is to analyse the impact that each of these components has on trade in emerging economies using a gravity model. Furthermore, the study also attempts to detect possible advances in logistics in developing countries, which are grouped into five regions (Africa, South America, Far East, Middle East and Eastern Europe) by comparing the first LPI data published in 2007 with the most recent data, released in 2012. The results obtained reveal that improvements in any of the components of the LPI can lead to significant growth in a countryâ€™s trade flows. Specifically, LPI components are becoming increasingly important for international trade in many countries in Africa, South America and Eastern Europe.},

This paper shows that, if the violation of labor standards results from discrimination against particular workers in export industries, employment, output, and competitiveness will be reduced since employment is determined by the short side of the market. If the problems arise from abuse of market power by employers, competitiveness will be similarly reduced. Only if freedom of association and collective bargaining were intended to allow workers in some sectors to restrict output and drive up wages would the absence of these standards raise competitiveness. However, if product markets are competitive, it is likely that association rights would increase output and competitiveness by raising productivity. The competitiveness argument seems either to reflect analytical confusion or to represent a cover for protectionist interests.},

This analysis suggests that a shift resulted in the odds of international migration and the motivations for leaving among inhabitants of Peruâ€™s largest labor market. Before 1987, under the regime of import substitution industrialization, jobs at wages capable of sustaining a basic standard of living were widely available; those few who left the country self-selected for higher human capital and moved abroad to improve their earnings. Under neoliberalism, however, both employment and wages fell to levels that made it difficult for families to sustain themselves. In response, householdsâ€”with the assistance of friends and relatives with foreign experienceâ€”diversified their labor portfolios away from the local job market structural adjustment zones. The number of migrants then rose, the diversity of foreign destinations increased, and migration became less selective with respect to human capital.},

  abstract = {The stakes for alleviating poverty and avoiding unbridled climate change are inextricably linked. Climate change impacts will slow down and may even reverse trends in poverty reduction. The pathways consistent with global warming of no more than 2 Â°C require strategies for poverty alleviation to make allowance for the constraint of low-carbon development. Existing climate funds have failed to target poverty alleviation as a high-priority strategy for adaptation or as a component of low-carbon development. This article proposes a funding window as part of the Green Climate Fund in order to foster synergies targeting greater satisfaction of basic needs, while making allowance for adaptation and mitigation. This financial mechanism is based on indicators of the satisfaction of basic needs and could respond to the claims of the developing countries, which see alleviating poverty as the first priority in climate negotiations. It defines a country continuum, given that there are poor people everywhere; all developing countries are therefore eligible with a mechanism of this sort.Policy relevanceThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) calls for substantial emissions reductions and adaptation strategies over the next decades to reduce the high risks of severe impacts of climate change over the 21st century. Industrialized countries and developing countries alike recognize the need to mitigate climate change and to adapt to it. But they face many challenges that lead to an â€˜emissions gapâ€™ between an emissions level consistent with the 2 Â°C increase limit and the voluntary pledges that they have made thus far in the climate negotiations (United Nations Environment Programme. (2014). The Emissions Gap Report 2014. A UNEP synthesis report). In this arena, many developing countries underline that their first domestic priority is the satisfaction of basic needs. In the run-up to the next climate negotiations at the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP 21) in Paris, the proposed poverty-adaptation-mitigation funding window could contribute to alleviate the conflict between development and climate goals in developing countries. In this sense, it could spur developing countries to integrate more ambitious emissions limitations pledges into their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions. This could in turn entice industrialized countries to act similarly. In the end, it could pave the way to an ambitious climate agreement in Paris at COP 21.},

The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) was created alongside other towering achievements of the post-World War II era, including the United Nations, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund. GATT, the first successful agreement to generate multilateral trade liberalization, became the principal institution to administer international trade for the next six decades. In this book, Petros Mavoidis offers detailed examination of the GATT regime for international trade, discussing the negotiating record, policy background, economic rationale, and case law. Mavroidis offers a substantive first chapter that provides a detailed historical background to GATT that stretches from the 1927 World Economic Conference through Bretton Woods and the Atlantic Charter. Each of the following chapters examines the disciplines agreed to, their negotiating record, their economic rationale, and subsequent practice. Mavroidis focuses on cases that have influenced the prevailing understanding of the norm, as well as on literature that has contributed to its interpretation, and the final outcome. In particular, he examines quantitative restrictions and tariffs; the most favored nation clause (MFN), the cornerstone of the GATT edifice; preferential trade agreements and special treatment for products originating in developing countries; domestic instruments; and exceptions to the obligations assumed under GATT. This book's companion volume examines World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements regulating trade in goods.},

  abstract = {Renewed emphasis on programs and policies aimed at enhancing food security has intensified the search for accurate, rapid, and consistent indicators. Measures of food security are urgently required for purposes of early warning, assessment of current and prospective status of at-risk populations, and monitoring and evaluation of specific programs and policies. Different measures are often used interchangeably, without a good idea of which dimensions of food security are captured by which measures, resulting in potentially significant misclassification of food insecure populations. The objective of this paper is to compare how the most frequently used indicators of food security portray static and dynamic food security among the same sample of rural households in two districts of Tigray State, Northern Ethiopia. Seven food security indicators were assessed: the Coping Strategies Index (CSI); the Reduced Coping Strategies Index (rCSI); the Household Food Insecurity and Access Scale (HFIAS); the Household Hunger Scale (HHS); Food Consumption Score (FCS); the Household Dietary Diversity Scale (HDDS); and a self-assessed measure of food security (SAFS). These indicators provide very different estimates of the prevalence of food insecurity, but are moderately well correlated and depict generally similar food security trends over time. We suggest that the differences in prevalence estimates, and in some cases the weaker than expected correlation, can be explained in three ways. First, the indicators differ in the underlying aspect of food security they attempt to capture. Second, each indicator is likely only sensitive within a certain severity range of food insecurity and these ranges do not always overlap. Third, categorization of the prevalence of food insecurity is strongly dependent on the choice of cut-off points. For valid reasons, â€œfood insecurityâ€ has no accepted gold standard metric against which individual indicators can be gauged, though without one it is difficult to say which indicator performs â€œbestâ€ in correctly and reliably identifying food insecure households. The implication is that using more than one indicator is advisable, and policy makers should be aware of what elements of food insecurity each indicator portrays.},

A review of state practice in different fields suggests the existence of relevant exceptions to the principle of full reparation. These exceptions relate to the financial capacity of responsible states, the indirect nature of the injury, considerations of â€œculpabilityâ€, and the limitations of collective responsibility as â€œroughâ€ justice. Accordingly, it is suggested that climate change reparations should be limited to partial compensation and symbolic measures of satisfaction prone to incentivize climate change mitigation.},

  abstract = {The economic empowerment of women is emerging as a core focus of both economic development and gender equality programmes internationally. At the same time, there is increasing importance placed on measuring outcomes and quantifying progress towards gender and development goals. These trends raise significant questions around how well gender differences are understood, especially in economies dominated by the informal sector and characterised by a highly gendered division of labour, as is the case in many Pacific countries. How well do existing international and national indicators of gender equality reflect the experiences and aspirations of Pacific women and men? What do concepts such as gender equality and economic empowerment mean in this geographical context? How might local attitudes and practices be identified and measured? In this paper, we draw on Boaventura De Sousa Santosâ€™ call to recognise and value knowledges of the majority world that have been rendered either largely invisible or non-credible by mainstream development and human rights policy agendas. Reflecting on an action research project conducted with partner organisations in Fiji and the Solomon islands, we explore a more nuanced place-based approach to understanding and measuring gender equality and economic empowerment. This approach takes account of diverse economic practices, such as non-market transactions, and forms of non-cash exchange and unpaid labour, and recognises the imbalance in womenâ€™s and menâ€™s household and care work.},

  abstract = {Growing awareness of the size and organizational potential of informal economies in the era of globalization has triggered a profusion of research on linkages between the formal and informal economies, moving in a range of empirical and theoretical directions. This Working Paper reviews over 200 items of current literature on formal-informal linkages under four categories â€“ linkage mapping, institutional design, governance effects, and the politics of formal-informal linkages. These four categories explore distinctive approaches to linkages as mechanisms for mapping, tapping, vesting or contesting the distribution of resources, power and legitimacy between the formal and informal economies. With a focus on developing countries, this Working Paper considers how the realities of globalization, market reforms, and the crisis of the global (formal) economy have reshaped the geographical, sectoral and regulatory scope of formal-informal linkages. It addresses a new, more complex problematic that focuses not only on patterns of linkages and whether they are beneficial or not, but also for whom, and with what impact on the governance structures of formal as well as informal economies. As the review shows, formal-informal linkages can improve but also worsen the distribution of costs and benefits, and so are not necessarily conducive to empowerment. The integration of informal workers and enterprises into global value chains, and the rise of complex multi-stakeholder networks have created new possibilities for inclusion of informal actors in wider structures of economic growth and decision making. But these linkages have also generated processes of outsourcing and labour informalization that have proven more exploitative than empowering. Innovative processes of co-production and political inclusion, while able to enhance informal political voice, can also turn formal-informal linkages into techniques of governance and subordination. Understanding the specific distributional effects and power relations within these networks is crucial to understanding their ultimate impact on informal economy actors. After examining what the existing literature reveals, and identifying research gaps, the author outlines policy implications and a framework for further research. Policy implications focus on the distinctive needs of entrepreneurial and survivalist informal actors; policies to encourage synergistic rather than exploitative linkages; the management of multi-stakeholder networks; and policy diagnostics for assessing the developmental impact of co-production and hybrid governance arrangements.},

The representativeness of various grade classifications, special services, and bureaus is also measured; and the United States upper civil service is compared to that of five other nations. After an attempt to measure the values of bureaucrats, the future concerns of the theory of representative bureaucracy are outlined.},

  abstract = {During the current seventh cholera pandemic, Africa bore the major brunt of global disease burden. More than 40 years after its resurgence in Africa in 1970, cholera remains a grave public health problem, characterized by large disease burden, frequent outbreaks, persistent endemicity, and high CFRs, particularly in the region of the central African Great Lakes which might act as reservoirs for cholera. There, cases occur year round with a rise in incidence during the rainy season. Elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa, cholera occurs mostly in outbreaks of varying size with a constant threat of widespread epidemics. Between 1970 and 2011, African countries reported 3,221,050 suspected cholera cases to the World Health Organization, representing 46 \% of all cases reported globally. Excluding the Haitian epidemic, sub-Saharan Africa accounted for 86 \% of reported cases and 99 \% of deaths worldwide in 2011. The number of cholera cases is possibly much higher than what is reported to the WHO due to the variation in modalities, completeness, and case definition of national cholera data. One source on country specific incidence rates for Africa, adjusting for underreporting, estimates 1,341,080 cases and 160,930 deaths (52.6 \% of 2,548,227 estimated cases and 79.6 \% of 209,216 estimated deaths worldwide). Another estimates 1,411,453 cases and 53,632 deaths per year, respectively (50 \% of 2,836,669 estimated cases and 58.6 \% of 91,490 estimated deaths worldwide). Within Africa, half of all cases between 1970 and 2011 were notified from only seven countries: Angola, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mozambique, Nigeria, Somalia, Tanzania, and South Africa. In contrast to a global trend of decreasing case fatality ratios (CFRs), CFRs have remained stable in Africa at approximately 2 \%. Early propagation of cholera outbreaks depends largely on the extent of individual bacterial shedding, host and organism characteristics, the likelihood of people coming into contact with an infectious dose of Vibrio cholerae and on the virulence of the implicated strain. Cholera transmission can then be amplified by several factors including contamination of human water- or food sources; climate and extreme weather events; political and economic crises; high population density combined with poor quality informal housing and poor hygiene practices; spread beyond a local community through human travel and animals, e.g., water birds. At an individual level, cholera risk may increase with decreasing immunity and hypochlorhydria, such as that induced by Helicobacter pylori infection, which is endemic in much of Africa, and may increase individual susceptibility and cholera incidence. Since contaminated water is the main vehicle for the spread of cholera, the obvious long-term solution to eradicate the disease is the provision of safe water to all African populations. This requires considerable human and financial resources and time. In the short and medium term, vaccination may help to prevent and control the spread of cholera outbreaks. Regardless of the intervention, further understanding of cholera biology and epidemiology is essential to identify populations and areas at increased risk and thus ensure the most efficient use of scarce resources for the prevention and control of cholera.},

  abstract = {Indicators are rapidly multiplying as tools for assessing and promoting a variety of social justice and reform strategies around the world. There are indicators of rule of law, indicators of violence against women, and indicators of economic development, among many others. Indicators are widely used at the national level and are increasingly important in global governance. There are increasing demands for â€œevidence-basedâ€ funding for nongovernmental organizations and for the results of civil society organizations to be quantifiable and measurable. The reliance on simplified numerical representations of complex phenomena began in strategies of national governance and economic analysis and has recently migrated to the regulation of nongovernmental organizations and human rights. The turn to indicators in the field of global governance introduces a new form of knowledge production with implications for relations of power between rich and poor nations and between governments and civil society. The deployment of statistical measures tends to replace political debate with technical expertise. The growing reliance on indicators provides an example of the dissemination of the corporate form of thinking and governance into broader social spheres.},

  abstract = {We live in a world where seemingly everything can be measured. We rely on indicators to translate social phenomena into simple, quantified terms, which in turn can be used to guide individuals, organizations, and governments in establishing policy. Yet counting things requires finding a way to make them comparable. And in the process of translating the confusion of social life into neat categories, we inevitably strip it of context and meaningâ€”and risk hiding or distorting as much as we reveal.  With The Seductions of Quantification, leading legal anthropologist Sally Engle Merry investigates the techniques by which information is gathered and analyzed in the production of global indicators on human rights, gender violence, and sex trafficking. Although such numbers convey an aura of objective truth and scientific validity, Merry argues persuasively that measurement systems constitute a form of power by incorporating theories about social change in their design but rarely explicitly acknowledging them. For instance, the US State Departmentâ€™s Trafficking in Persons Report, which ranks countries in terms of their compliance with antitrafficking activities, assumes that prosecuting traffickers as criminals is an effective corrective strategyâ€”overlooking cultures where women and children are frequently sold by their own families. As Merry shows, indicators are indeed seductive in their promise of providing concrete knowledge about how the world works, but they are implemented most successfully when paired with context-rich qualitative accounts grounded in local knowledge.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an overview of the trade and policy issues in the United Nationsâ€™ Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It assesses the dramatic changes in the political, economic, and business background from the early 2000s (shaping the MDGs) to the early 2010s (designing the SDGs). These changes rarely get the attention they merit, despite their profound consequences on how to useâ€”or not useâ€”trade policies for promoting development. Following this, it examines the three major phases in the MDG/SDG progress: first, a pro-trade agenda during the preparation of the MDG Report (2002â€“2005) insisting on the positive impact of trade for development ifâ€”a big ifâ€”economically sound trade policies are adopted; then, uninspiring MDG8 Gap Reports cantoned in the increasingly sterileâ€”and economically unsoundâ€”World Trade Organization negotiations during the implementation period of the MDGs (2007â€“2015); finally, the ignorance of the trade potential for a â€œbetter lifeâ€ during the preparation of the SDGs (2013â€“2015). The paper also provides a telling comparison of the MDGsâ€™ and SDGsâ€™ very different inputs and outputs. The paper concludes by stressing the largely ignored common regulatory agenda between trade policies and the SDGs, arguing that a well-designed trade policy could play a key role for improving domestic regulations, and, hence, contribute to the SDGsâ€™ ultimate goalâ€”a â€œbetter lifeâ€.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h2{$>$}Summary{$<$}/h2{$><$}h3{$>$}Background{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3 aims to "ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages". While a substantial effort has been made to quantify progress towards SDG3, less research has focused on tracking spending towards this goal. We used spending estimates to measure progress in financing the priority areas of SDG3, examine the association between outcomes and financing, and identify where resource gains are most needed to achieve the SDG3 indicators for which data are available.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Methods{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}We estimated domestic health spending, disaggregated by source (government, out-of-pocket, and prepaid private) from 1995 to 2017 for 195 countries and territories. For disease-specific health spending, we estimated spending for HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis for 135 low-income and middle-income countries, and malaria in 106 malaria-endemic countries, from 2000 to 2017. We also estimated development assistance for health (DAH) from 1990 to 2019, by source, disbursing development agency, recipient, and health focus area, including DAH for pandemic preparedness. Finally, we estimated future health spending for 195 countries and territories from 2018 until 2030. We report all spending estimates in inflation-adjusted 2019 US\$, unless otherwise stated.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Findings{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Since the development and implementation of the SDGs in 2015, global health spending has increased, reaching \$7Â·9 trillion (95\% uncertainty interval 7Â·8â€“8Â·0) in 2017 and is expected to increase to \$11Â·0 trillion (10Â·7â€“11Â·2) by 2030. In 2017, in low-income and middle-income countries spending on HIV/AIDS was \$20Â·2 billion (17Â·0â€“25Â·0) and on tuberculosis it was \$10Â·9 billion (10Â·3â€“11Â·8), and in malaria-endemic countries spending on malaria was \$5Â·1 billion (4Â·9â€“5Â·4). Development assistance for health was \$40Â·6 billion in 2019 and HIV/AIDS has been the health focus area to receive the highest contribution since 2004. In 2019, \$374 million of DAH was provided for pandemic preparedness, less than 1\% of DAH. Although spending has increased across HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria since 2015, spending has not increased in all countries, and outcomes in terms of prevalence, incidence, and per-capita spending have been mixed. The proportion of health spending from pooled sources is expected to increase from 81Â·6\% (81Â·6â€“81Â·7) in 2015 to 83Â·1\% (82Â·8â€“83Â·3) in 2030.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Interpretation{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Health spending on SDG3 priority areas has increased, but not in all countries, and progress towards meeting the SDG3 targets has been mixed and has varied by country and by target. The evidence on the scale-up of spending and improvements in health outcomes suggest a nuanced relationship, such that increases in spending do not always results in improvements in outcomes. Although countries will probably need more resources to achieve SDG3, other constraints in the broader health system such as inefficient allocation of resources across interventions and populations, weak governance systems, human resource shortages, and drug shortages, will also need to be addressed.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Funding{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}The Bill \& Melinda Gates Foundation.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

While a substantial effort has been made to quantify progress towards SDG3, less research has focused on tracking spending towards this goal. We used spending estimates to measure progress in financing the priority areas of SDG3, examine the association between outcomes and financing, and identify where resource gains are most needed to achieve the SDG3 indicators for which data are available.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Methods{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}We estimated domestic health spending, disaggregated by source (government, out-of-pocket, and prepaid private) from 1995 to 2017 for 195 countries and territories. For disease-specific health spending, we estimated spending for HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis for 135 low-income and middle-income countries, and malaria in 106 malaria-endemic countries, from 2000 to 2017. We also estimated development assistance for health (DAH) from 1990 to 2019, by source, disbursing development agency, recipient, and health focus area, including DAH for pandemic preparedness. Finally, we estimated future health spending for 195 countries and territories from 2018 until 2030. We report all spending estimates in inflation-adjusted 2019 US\$, unless otherwise stated.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Findings{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Since the development and implementation of the SDGs in 2015, global health spending has increased, reaching \$7Â·9 trillion (95\% uncertainty interval 7Â·8â€“8Â·0) in 2017 and is expected to increase to \$11Â·0 trillion (10Â·7â€“11Â·2) by 2030. In 2017, in low-income and middle-income countries spending on HIV/AIDS was \$20Â·2 billion (17Â·0â€“25Â·0) and on tuberculosis it was \$10Â·9 billion (10Â·3â€“11Â·8), and in malaria-endemic countries spending on malaria was \$5Â·1 billion (4Â·9â€“5Â·4). Development assistance for health was \$40Â·6 billion in 2019 and HIV/AIDS has been the health focus area to receive the highest contribution since 2004. In 2019, \$374 million of DAH was provided for pandemic preparedness, less than 1\% of DAH. Although spending has increased across HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria since 2015, spending has not increased in all countries, and outcomes in terms of prevalence, incidence, and per-capita spending have been mixed. The proportion of health spending from pooled sources is expected to increase from 81Â·6\% (81Â·6â€“81Â·7) in 2015 to 83Â·1\% (82Â·8â€“83Â·3) in 2030.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Interpretation{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Health spending on SDG3 priority areas has increased, but not in all countries, and progress towards meeting the SDG3 targets has been mixed and has varied by country and by target. The evidence on the scale-up of spending and improvements in health outcomes suggest a nuanced relationship, such that increases in spending do not always results in improvements in outcomes. Although countries will probably need more resources to achieve SDG3, other constraints in the broader health system such as inefficient allocation of resources across interventions and populations, weak governance systems, human resource shortages, and drug shortages, will also need to be addressed.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Funding{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}The Bill \& Melinda Gates Foundation.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {We analyze the interaction of climate and development policy that has taken place since the early 1990s. Increasing dissatisfaction about the results of traditional development cooperation and the appeal of climate policy as a new policy field led to a rapid reorientation of aid flows. At the turn of the century, over 7\% of aid flows were spent on greenhouse gas emissions mitigation. However, the contribution of emissions mitigation projects to the central development objective of poverty reduction as specified in the Millennium Development Goals is limited and other project types are likely to be much more effective. Adaptation to climate change can be expected to have higher synergies with poverty alleviation than mitigation, primarily through its impact on health, the conservation of arable land and the protection against natural disasters. An analysis of the Clean Development Mechanism shows that projects addressing the poor directly are very rare; even small renewable energy projects in rural areas tend to benefit rich farmers and the urban population. Use of development aid for CDM projects and/or their preparation via capacity building is thus clearly not warranted. We further analyze whether the use of development aid for climate policy could be justified as a countermeasure against the emission increase related to successful development itself. However, countries that are achieving an improvement of human development from a low level are unlikely to increase their energy consumption substantially. Only at a level where the middle class expands rapidly, energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions soar. Thus targeting middle class energy consumption by appliance efficiency standards and public transport-friendly urban planning are the most effective measures to address developing country emissions. Rural renewable energy provision in poor countries has a much higher impact on poverty, but a much lower impact on greenhouse gas emissions. We conclude that while there are valid reasons for long-term collaboration with emerging economies on greenhouse gas mitigation, there should be a separate budget line for such activities to avoid "obfuscation" of a decline of resources aimed at poverty alleviation. Nevertheless, mitigation will remain attractive for donors because it ensures quick disbursements and relatively simple measures of success. Moreover, mitigation activities in developing countries provide politicians in industrialized countries with a welcome strategy to divert the attention of their constituencies from the lack of success in reducing greenhouse gas emissions domestically.

We used DHS data from Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda to test factor structure and measurement invariance of womenâ€™s empowerment among married women ages 15â€“49. Factor analysis confirmed a three-latent-domain model of womenâ€™s empowerment in each country capturing womenâ€™s human/social assets, gender attitudes related to wife abuse, and womenâ€™s participation in household decisions. Multi-country confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) identified an invariant three-factor model of womenâ€™s empowerment and a subset of country-specific items. Our results offer a standardized, invariant measure of womenâ€™s empowerment that can be applied to monitor womenâ€™s empowerment cross-nationally in East Africa, and possibly beyond.},

  abstract = {Background: The role of community health workers (CHWs) in the West Africa Ebola outbreak has been highlighted to advocate for increasing numbers of CHWs globally to build resilience, strengthen health systems, and provide emergency response capacity. However, the roles CHWs played, the challenges they faced, and their effectiveness during the outbreak are not well documented. This study assessed the impact of Ebola on community-based maternal, newborn, and child health (MNCH) services, documented the contribution of CHWs and other community-based actors to the Ebola response, and identified lessons learned to strengthen resilience in future emergencies. Methods: This mixed methods study was conducted in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, with data collected in four Ebola-affected districts of each country. Qualitative data were collected through in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with stakeholders at national, district, and community levels. Quantitative program data were used to assess trends in delivery of community-based MNCH services. Results: There was a sharp decline in MNCH service provision due to weak service delivery, confusion over policy, and the overwhelming nature of the outbreak. However, many CHWs remained active in their communities and were willing to continue providing services. When CHWs received clear directives and were supported, service provision rebounded. Although CHWs faced mistrust and hostility from community members because of their linkages to health facilities, the relationship between CHWs and communities proved resilient over time, and CHWs were more effectively able to carry out Ebola-related activities than outsiders. Traditional birth attendants, community health committees, community leaders, and traditional healers also played important roles, despite a lack of formal engagement or support. Service delivery weaknesses, especially related to supply chain and supervision, limited the effectiveness of community health services before, during, and after the outbreak. Conclusions: CHWs and other community-level actors played important roles during the Ebola outbreak. However, maintenance of primary care services and the Ebola response were hampered because community actors were engaged late in the response and did not receive sufficient support. In the future, communities should be placed at the forefront of emergency preparedness and response plans and they must be adequately supported to strengthen service delivery.},

  abstract = {Background: The conflict in Yemen has devastated the health system, with only 51\% of health facilities classified as fully functional and 19.7 million people lacking access to health care. To address the urgent need for primary health care services in rural communities, Save the Children launched an iCCM program in Lahj and Taiz Governorates. A qualitative study was conducted to document the challenges to iCCM service delivery and to aid in developing strategies for overcoming service delivery bottlenecks in conflict-affected rural areas. Methods: Qualitative data were collected in Aden City, Lahj Governorate, and Taiz Governorate. Twenty-three IDIs and six FGDs were conducted with iCCM stakeholders at all levels. Results: Key findings included: 1) Policy, coordination, and funding were challenged by the fact that iCCM was not integrated into the national health system and was implemented as a short-term emergency program. 2) Villages that received services from a CHW who was based in a different community experienced reduced access to services, especially during times of heightened conflict and insecurity, when CHWs could not travel. 3) Supervision, supply chain, and monitoring were all challenges that were exacerbated by difficulties in travel due to the conflict. Potential solutions to these included the use of mobile technology for supervision and data collection and pre-positioning of buffer stocks in locations closer to CHWs. 4) Travel was seen as the primary threat to the safety of CHWs and supervisors. Measures taken to reduce the risk included limiting travel during periods of heightened insecurity, safety training for CHWs, and use of mobile technology for communication. Conclusions: CHWs were able to provide iCCM services in a challenging and insecure context. The challenges in delivery of services were related to both a weak health system and the conflict. Several adaptations to service delivery to overcome the bottlenecks have been identified and should be considered for future community health programs. The closure of the program in Taiz after only 14 months of implementation is a stark illustration of the failure of the current model of short-term humanitarian funding to address long-term needs in protracted emergencies.},

In this paper, I examine how the Mexican federal government has implemented measurement and monitoring regimes to track and respond to maternal deaths. Drawing on field research and interviews conducted at various times between 2004 and 2010, I consider some of the contradictory knowledge and governance effects that this turn to measurement has generated in the Mexican health-care system. Measurement and monitoring regimes, I argue, have given maternal health advocates the evidence to argue that it is failings within the health-care system which have made high levels of mortality so intractable. At the same time, measuring mortality has rendered broader aspects of sexual and reproductive rights less visible, while also generating a politics of responsibility and culpability. I trace in this paper a tendency by some health-care professionals to resist what they see as the punitive nature of maternal health monitoring regimes, by either â€˜gamingâ€™ the numbers, and/or shifting responsibility other, usually more vulnerable, populations. This analysis highlights the importance of attending to the context in which measurement regimes are introduced. In the context of a deeply flawed system, measurement regimes will generate tensions around responsibility which cannot easily be resolved, and may be resisted by those on whom the regime depends for its reliability.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Why do countries sometimes use multilateral strategies and institutions for pursuing their foreign policies? Since World War Two the advanced industrial countries â€“ basically, the OECD countries â€“ have chosen to distribute part of their foreign aid through multilateral organizations, such as the European Union (EU), World Bank, IMF, UN, and regional development banks (RDBs). In particular I want to understand why these countries have chosen to delegate varying amounts of aid to these international organizations over the past 40 years. The delegation of aid-giving to multilateral organizations is surprising; it reduces a country's control over its own foreign policy and has the potential to increase principal-agent problems associated with all spending programs. The other choice that these countries had was to use their own bilateral aid agencies to select projects and oversee aid expenditures, which was the traditional practice prior to the 1960s. So the question addressed is why delegate the provision of foreign aid to a multilateral organization instead of using traditional bilateral channels. The total amount of such multilateral aid is not inconsequential. For instance, the World Bank gives aid in two main forms. The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) uses its donor subscription base as collateral to borrow money on world capital markets, which it then lends at below market interest rates to developing countries. In 2001 the IBRD committed roughly \$10.5 billion in low interest loans (World Bank 2001a).},

It applies panel data model to examine the effects of composite infrastructure index and its individual components on human development and its three dimensions. The study establishes close linkage between infrastructure and human development. Telecommunication, postal services, village electricity, banking, school, PTR and drinking water facilities play significant roles in the process of attaining high level of human development. The less developed districts of Odisha are primarily dominated by tribal population. In order to achieve high and sustained human development, the state needs to prioritize its efforts towards infrastructure creation for these regions.},

However, few explicitly examine whether the impact of aid on reform is mediated by recipient regime type. I argue that conditional aid is effective but its efficacy depends on recipient countriesâ€™ level of democracy because the value of aid to governments depends on the degree to which it helps them maintain power, and recent work shows that the marginal impact of aid on political survival increases with level of democracy. I test this argument on data from 68 countries over the period from 1980 to 1999. I focus on the impact of IMF and World Bank aid on fiscal reform, one of the most commonly stipulated conditions in aid-for-policy arrangements. I find that aid from the Bretton Woods institutions promotes fiscal reform, but only in more democratic countries. KeywordsAid conditionality-Democracy-Policy reform},

We define a sustainable city as the spatial entity that maximises the benefits in economic and social dimensions under relevant constraints on environmental limitations and socio-economic distributional equity. Based on the definition, we provide five expressive forms as a framework for judging city sustainability, using a concept of two types of indicators: constraint and maximisation indicators. Constraint indicators judge sustainability of cities based on relevant criteria in terms of environmental sustainability and socio-economic distributional justice. Maximisation indicators measure the benefits cities produce in economic and social aspects. Indicators in the three dimensions â€“ environmental, economic and social indicators â€“ can be categorised into the two types of indicators. In conclusion, we need to assess the two dimensions of cities â€“ limitations and benefits â€“ independently without offsetting one against the other in terms of strong sustainability.},

This research conducts a mixed-method approach including binary logistic regression and multiple regressions to analyze the factors that influence access to and volume of funding from the AF, respectively, along with a qualitative assessment of the AFâ€™s institutional features. The findings suggest that the level of vulnerability of a country is likely to affect accessibility to and the volume of funding from the AF. Besides, low-income countries are more likely while least developed countries are less likely to access the fund. Readiness of country is not significant for accessing the AF; however, it affects the volume of funding. Funding allocation rearrangement may put the AF on pressure for effective use of the readiness program.},

Prospective cohort studies are key to study multiple risk factors and chronic diseases and are crucial to our understanding of the burden, aetiology and prognosis of NCDs in SSA. We aimed to identify the level of research output on NCDs and their risk factors collected by cohorts in SSA. Methods: We conducted a scoping review to map the extent of current NCDs research in SSA by identifying studies published after the year 2000 using prospectively collected cohort data on any of the six NCDs (cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, obesity, chronic kidney disease, chronic respiratory diseases, and cancers), â‰¥1 major risk factor (other than age and sex), set only within SSA, enrolled â‰¥500 participants, and â‰¥12 months of follow-up with â‰¥2 data collection points (or with plans to). We performed a systematic search of databases, a manual search of references lists from included articles and the INDEPTH network website, and study investigators from SSA were contacted for further articles. Results: We identified 30 cohort studies from the 101 included articles. Eighteen countries distributed in West, Central, East and Southern Africa, were represented. The majority (27\%) set in South Africa. There were three studies including children, twenty with adults, and seven with both. 53\% of cohorts were sampled in general populations, 47\% in clinical populations, and 1 occupational cohort study. Hypertension (n\,=\,23) was most commonly reported, followed by obesity (n\,=\,16), diabetes (n\,=\,15), CKD (n\,=\,6), COPD (n\,=\,2), cervical cancer (n\,=\,3), and breast cancer (n\,=\,1). The majority (n\,=\,22) reported data on at least one demographic/environmental, lifestyle, or physiological risk factor but these data varied greatly. Conclusions: Most studies collected data on a combination of hypertension, diabetes, and obesity and few studies collected data on respiratory diseases and cancer. Although most collected data on different risk factors the methodologies varied greatly. Several methodological limitations were found including low recruitment rate, low retention rate, and lack of validated and standardized data collection. Our results could guide potential collaborations and maximize impact to improve our global understanding of NCDs (and their risk factors) in SSA and also to inform future research, as well as policies.},

In this article, we analyze the economic and disaster data from 1970 through 2010 to investigate the impact of disasters on country/region-level economic growth. We leveraged a random parameter modeling approach to develop the growth-econometrics model that identifies risk factors significantly influencing~the country/region-level economic growth in the face of natural hazard-induced disasters, while controlling for country/region- and time-specific unobserved heterogeneities. We found that disaster intensity in terms of fatalities and homelessness, and economic characteristics such as~openness to trade and a governmentâ€™s consumption share of purchasing power parity~(PPP), are the significant risk factors that randomly vary for different countries/regions. Other significant factors found to be significant include population, real gross domestic product~(GDP), and investment share~of PPP converted GDP per capita. We also found that flood is the most devastating disaster to affect country/region-level economic growth. This growth-econometrics model will help in the policy and decision making of governments related to the investment needs for pre- and post-disaster risk mitigation and response planning~strategies, to better protect nations and minimize disaster-induced economic impacts.},

Although Global Health Capacity Building (GHCB) initiatives are recommended approaches, they risk being ineffective in the absence of standardized evaluation methods. This study systematically reviews evaluation approaches for GHCB initiatives in LMICs. Methods: We searched the Medline (OVID), PubMed, Scopus, and Embase.com databases for studies reporting evaluation of a GHCB initiative in a LMIC from January 1, 2009 until August 15, 2019. To differentiate them from intervention, prevention, and awareness initiatives, included articles reported at least one approach to evaluate their learning modality. We excluded cross-sectional studies, reviews, and book chapters that only assessed the effect of interventions. Data identifying the learning modality, and evaluation method, level, time interval, and approach were extracted from articles as primary outcomes. Results: Of 8324 identified studies, 63 articles were eligible for analysis. Most studies stemmed from Africa and Asia (69.8\%), were delivered and evaluated face-to-face (74.6\% and 76.2\%), mainly to professionals (57.1\%) and community workers (20.6\%). Although the use of online and blended modalities showed an increase over the past 4 years, only face-to-face initiatives were evaluated long-term beyond individual-level. GHCB evaluations in general lacked standardization especially regarding the tools. Conclusion: This is an important resource for evaluating GHCB initiatives in LMICs. It synthesizes evaluation approaches, offers recommendations for improvement, and calls for the standardization of evaluations, especially for long-term and wider impact assessment of online and blended modalities.},

Through the 1980s and 1990s, donor countries and institutions trended to make aid conditional upon reforms in the recipient country, which was found largely ineffective in encouraging real policy changes. More recently, donors, such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the United States, are increasingly insisting upon performance and good governance as a prerequisite for aid, a practice called â€œselectivity.â€ This is a means of requiring a recipient state to demonstrate the seriousness of its commitment to economic and social reforms. There are no objective standards for determining good governance: some aspects include political stability, the rule of law, control of corruption, and accountability. High levels of poverty and weak governance are linked, making selectivity difficult to implement. For reforms to succeed, domestic support, ownership, and commitment are crucial, as are the recipient's cultural context and history.},

The transparency and disclosure policies of the World Bank and regional development banks are found to vary in important details. Their policies have advanced the status of transparency in development discourse and practice, and contributed to redefining the relationships among MDBs, states and citizens. At the same time they set limits that constrain information disclosure's significance in practice.},

More specifically, it considers whether IFIs are powerful â€œglobalizersâ€ of the developing world or ineffective organizations whose grand plans are forever thwarted by savvy governments promising sweeping reforms that never materialize. Drawing on the findings from thirty-one recent empirical studies, it concludes that there is no clear evidence that the IFIsâ€™ conditional lending has significant effects on structural reforms in developing countries. Nevertheless, the chapter argues that we should not regard the IFIs as completely useless agents in the effort to remake developing countriesâ€™ economies over the past thirty years, suggesting that their indirect effects on liberalizing policy reforms may be more important than the direct effects.},

  abstract = {The IMF is a purposive actor in world politics, primarily driven by a set of homogenous economic ideas, Stephen C. Nelson suggests, and its professional staff emerged from an insular set of American-trained economists. The IMF treats countries differently depending on whether that staff trusts the country's top officials; that trust in turn depends on the educational credentials of the policy team that Fund officials face across the negotiating table. Intellectual differences thus lead to lasting economic effects for the citizens of countries seeking IMF support.Based on deep archival research in IMF archives and personnel files, Nelson argues that the IMF has been the Johnny Appleseed of neoliberalism: neoliberal policymakers sprout and take root in countries that have spent recent decades living under the Fundâ€™s conditional lending arrangements. Nelson supports his argument through quantitative measures and illustrates the dynamics of relations between the Fund and client countries in a detailed examination of newly available archives of four periods in Argentinaâ€™s long and often bitter relations with the IMF. The Currency of Confidence ends with Nelsonâ€™s examination of how the IMF emerged from the global financial crisis as an unexpected victor.},

The flows of trade, capital, labour, technology and information across national borders have accelerated since the 1980s and created an environment conducive to faster economic growth and transmission of knowledge. It is evident that the forces of globalization provide a strong potential for a major reduction in poverty in the developing world. However, for a number of reasons brought out in this chapter, the positive impact of globalization on poverty alleviation worldwide has not been as substantial as one might have expected. In this chapter we explore structural factors and policies within the world economy and national economies that impede the full transmission of the benefits of the various channels of globalization to poverty reduction.},

The paper notes that four factors are essential in explaining this, namely the economy, scepticism about climate science, hegemonic drives and a quest for distributive justice. Notwithstanding, USG reluctance to accept LBGERTs is shaped by the convergence of interests of key actors in US political system who conceive government action to combat climate as a threat to their interests, although this can be reinforced or dissuaded by party ideology. While party ideology could strengthen or weaken US actions to fight climate change, the shielding of its sovereignty remains paramount regardless of ideological differences between the Democrats and Republicans. It indicates that while it could be argued that the Kyoto Protocol was a failed regime given the wide acceptance of the Paris Agreement, the planned withdrawal of US from Paris Agreement demonstrates that the Kyoto Protocol was not wholly a failure and buttressed the need to have a legally binding agreement (LBA). Also, it argues that the success of the Paris Agreement is a function of trust, reputation and reciprocity among countries that are parties to it.},

Over the decades, different authors have proposed different definitions and measurement methods that have been applauded for a while before being discarded as inadequate. This paper examines some definitions of poverty in detail and argues that the way poverty has been defined over the years has influenced the kind of poverty alleviation initiatives that have been designed and implemented. The paper further argues that these poverty alleviation initiatives have been temporal and unsustainable because they have been trying to solve a wrongly defined concept. The prevalent definitions of poverty would best be described as fruits of poverty, rather than poverty itself. This paper will, therefore, examine these definitions of poverty and how these definitions have ill-informed the current ineffective and unsustainable poverty eradication strategies. It will then put forward a new definition of poverty that came out of a qualitative, rights-based approach to participative action research, which was a part of a Ph.D. field study, conducted in rural Malawi and its implications.},

  abstract = {Scholars and practitioners have been working on methodologies to measure water security at a variety of scale and focus. In this paper, we critically examine the landscape of water security metrics, discussing the progress and gaps of this rich scholarship. We reviewed a total of 107 publications consisting of 17 conceptual papers and 90 methodological papers that propose 80 metrics to measure water security and observed that there are two dominant research clusters in this field: experiential scale-based metrics and resource-based metrics. The former mainly focus on measuring the water experiences of households and its impact on human well-being, while the majority of the latter assess freshwater availability or water resources security. We compare their approaches and the arguments used to develop them. We posit that the more local the scale and the more specific the water domain, the more meaningful results that the metrics can provide. Acknowledging the interrelationship between different water domains (e.g., water resources and water hazards) is important, but their aggregation for measurement may be problematic. We offer our views on future work in this field relating to topics beyond water, the need to conduct validation tests, and collaboration among academics and with other stakeholders.

The analysis is based on the views of 133 respondents â€“ 88 developing countries, 35 donors, 5 providers of South-South trade-related support and 5 regional organisations â€“ who participated in the 2019 aid-for-trade monitoring and evaluation exercise. They share the view that economic diversification is a gateway for economic empowerment, but also that empowerment is essential for economic diversification particularly when it enables youth, women and micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises to engage in international trade.},

  abstract = {The international response to the evolving Ebola epidemic in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has had interim successes while facing ongoing difficulties. The outbreak has occurred in an area of intractable conflict among multiple armed groups at a time of contentious national elections. Despite porous international borders and considerable population movement, however, transmission has been confined to North Kivu and Ituri provinces. Factors potentially contributing to this containment include conduct of about 55 million screenings, surveillance of contacts (12,591 under surveillance currently), testing of 280 samples per day, provision of safe and dignified burials for most deaths, vaccination of high-risk people (112,485 vaccinated as of May 7, 2019), and medical treatment including four investigational therapies. Major challenges remain. Since late February 2019, a sharp rise in cases and increased transmission have been observed. These coincide with organized attacks by armed groups targeting response teams, deteriorating security, and the populationâ€™s increasing distrust of the response effort. The risk of local and regional spread remains high given the high proportion of deaths occurring outside treatment facilities, relatively low proportions of new patients who were known contacts, ongoing nosocomial transmission, and persistent delays in detection and reporting. Stopping this epidemic will require the alignment of the principal political and armed groups in eastern DRC in support of the response.},

  abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between gender and social capital in adapting to climate variability in the arid and semi-arid regions in Turkana in Kenya. This paper undertook literature review of secondary data sources, conducted focus group discussions (FGDs) and key informant interviews (KIIs). The statistical package for the social sciences (SPSS) was used to analyze data for the quantitative part of the paper. Vulnerability is influenced by age, gender, education and disability. Elderly women are considered to be the most vulnerable to climate variability and change because they are the poorest in the community, followed by elderly men, the disabled, female-headed households, married women, men and, finally, the youth. Less than 30 per cent of women and men in both Katilu and Loima are able to read and write. The cross-tabulation results show that there is a statistical significant relationship between gender, age and education level and climate change vulnerability. This implies that gender, age and education level have a significant effect on climate change vulnerability. The research coverage was limited to only two regions in Turkana because of time and economic constraints. The lack of attention to gender in the climate change literature has time and again resulted in an oversimplification of womenâ€™s and men's experience of climate risks. Improved development assistance, investments and enhanced targeting of the truly vulnerable within pastoral societies demand an acceptance of underdevelopment in arid and semi-arid regions in Kenya because of historical imbalances in investment; the recognition that vulnerability of pastoralists is neither uniform nor universal and the need to consider differences like age, gender and education. Policy-makers should understand that pastoralists in the past have used indigenous knowledge to cope with and adapt to climate change. The current-recurrent and intensity droughts require investment in modern technology, equipping pastoralists with relevant information and skills to make them resilient to climate change and implementing existing and relevant policies for northern Kenya. This paper draws from several other efforts to show the critical relationships between gender, social capital and climate change. They are tracking adaptation and measuring development framework; ending drought emergencies common programme framework; and feminist evaluation approach. This paper is important in identifying the link between gender, social capital and adaptation to climate change.},

I will try to explain why economists for free trade start to defend some protectionist steps for some industries and why some countries protect their important industries to gain more, although they are members of GATT and WTO. There are a lot of theoretical and empirical studies on the possibility that strategic trade policies can enable firms to increase their share of rents from oligopolistic international markets. The theoretical strategic trade literature makes clear that this is a controversial result. Despite these concerns, the empirical literature continues to grow. In the same time, the attempts to liberalize the trade between nations are still growing. General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and its successor, the World Trade Organization (WTO) is one of the most cited examples of a successful international institution to liberalize international trade. But even if the WTO annual reports and website are analyzed, someone easily understand that GATT and WTO still have problems on applying free trade and telling itself to countries and individual whether GATT and WTO are for free trade or not. There are ten misunderstanding on the WTO website about WTO, most important of them is â€œcommercial interest takes priority over development, WTO ignores development and WTO acts blindly for free tradeâ€.},

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is supporting the development of a national index to measure and understand infrastructure performance. In contrast to established infrastructure assessments which rely on dollars spent or counting highway miles, this index applies a rigorous, repeatable, and universal methodology to quantify infrastructure performance. This article documents the methodology for developing a national infrastructure index and the application for one sector: transportation. The integration of the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) into the methodology as a mechanism to weight performance indicators is discussed as well as the challenges faced in constructing a Transportation Performance Index.},

This paper argues that such rapid reductions will become increasingly hard to achieve for two reasons. First, the majority of the poor now live in middle-income countries where the benefits of growth have often been distributed selectively and unequally. Second, a reservoir of extreme poverty remains in low-income countries where growth is erratic and aid often fails to reach the poor. If the international community is to most effectively leverage available resources to end extreme poverty, it must ensure that its investments in institutions and physical infrastructure actually provide the poor the capabilities they need to craft an effective pathway out of poverty. We term the human and social systems that are required to form this pathway â€œinvisible infrastructureâ€ and argue that an effective domestic state is central to building this. By corollary, ending extreme poverty will require both expanding state capacity and giving the poor power to demand reforms they need by solving agency problems between citizens, politicians, and bureaucrats.},

  abstract = {Background: Until recently, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated the annual mortality burden of influenza to be 250\,000 to 500\,000 all-cause deaths globally; however, a 2017 study indicated a substantially higher mortality burden, at 290\,000-650\,000 influenza-associated deaths from respiratory causes alone, and a 2019 study estimated 99\,000-200\,000 deaths from lower respiratory tract infections directly caused by influenza. Here we revisit global and regional estimates of influenza mortality burden and explore mortality trends over time and geography. Methods: We compiled influenza-associated excess respiratory mortality estimates for 31 countries representing 5 WHO regions during 2002-2011. From these we extrapolated the influenza burden for all 193 countries of the world using a multiple imputation approach. We then used mixed linear regression models to identify factors associated with high seasonal influenza mortality burden, including influenza types and subtypes, health care and socio-demographic development indicators, and baseline mortality levels. Results: We estimated an average of 389\,000 (uncertainty range 294\,000-518\,000) respiratory deaths were associated with influenza globally each year during the study period, corresponding to\,\textasciitilde\,2\% of all annual respiratory deaths. Of these, 67\% were among people 65 years and older. Global burden estimates were robust to the choice of countries included in the extrapolation model. For people {$<$}65 years, higher baseline respiratory mortality, lower level of access to health care and seasons dominated by the A(H1N1)pdm09 subtype were associated with higher influenza-associated mortality, while lower level of socio-demographic development and A(H3N2) dominance was associated with higher influenza mortality in adults â‰¥65 years. Conclusions: Our global estimate of influenza-associated excess respiratory mortality is consistent with the 2017 estimate, despite a different modelling strategy, and the lower 2019 estimate which only captured deaths directly caused by influenza. Our finding that baseline respiratory mortality and access to health care are associated with influenza-related mortality in persons {$<$}65 years suggests that health care improvements in low and middle-income countries might substantially reduce seasonal influenza mortality. Our estimates add to the body of evidence on the variation in influenza burden over time and geography, and begin to address the relationship between influenza-associated mortality, health and development.},

This article investigates the strategic nature of organizational responses to IATI.

  abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has brought data to the centre of policymaking and public attention. A diverse ecosystem of data producers, both private and public, report rates of infection, fatality and recovery on a daily basis. However, a proliferation of data, which is at times contradictory, can also lead to confusion and mistrust among data users. Meanwhile, policymakers, development partners and citizens need to take quick, informed actions to design interventions that reach the most vulnerable and leave no one behind. As countries comply with lockdowns and other containment measures, national statistical systems (NSSs) face a dual effect of growing data demand and constrained supply. This in turn may squeeze NSSs beyond their institutional capacity. At the same time, alternative data sources such as mobile phone or satellite data are in abundance. These data could potentially complement traditional sources such as censuses, surveys and administrative systems. However, with scant governance frameworks to scale and sustain their use, policy action is not yet based on a convergence of evidence. This policy brief introduces a conceptual framework that describes the adverse effects of the crisis on NSSs in developing countries. Moreover, it suggests short and medium-term actions to mitigate the negative effects by: 1. Focusing data production on priority economic, social and demographic data. 2. Communicating proactively with citizens, academia, private sector and policy makers. 3. Positioning the NSO as advisor and knowledge bank for national governments. NSSs contribute significantly to robust policy responses in a crisis. The brief thus calls on national statistical offices to assume a central role as coordinators of the NSSs and chart the way toward improved data ecosystem governance for informing policies during and after COVID-19.},

Moreover, the book warns that an obsession with measurement rather than process can undermine efforts to foster transformative and empowering outcomes. It concludes that power must be restored as the centrepiece of empowerment.

  abstract = {Sustainable development has broad appeal and little specificity, but some combination of development and environment as well as equity is found in many attempts to describe it. However, proponents of sustainable development differ in their emphases on what is to be sustained, what is to be developed, how to link environment and development, and for how long a time. Despite the persistent definitional ambiguities associated with sustainable development, much work (over 500 efforts) has been devoted to developing quantitative indicators of sustainable development. The emphasis on sustainability indicators has multiple motivations that include decision making and management, advocacy, participation and consensus building, and research and analysis. We select a dozen prominent examples and use this review to highlight their similarities and differences in definition of sustainable development, motivation, process, and technical methods. We conclude that there are no indicator sets that are universally accepted, backed by compelling theory, rigorous data collection and analysis, and influential in policy. This is due to the ambiguity of sustainable development, the plurality of purpose in characterizing and measuring sustainable development, and the confusion of terminology, data, and methods of measurement. A major step in reducing such confusion would be the acceptance of distinctions in terminology, data, and methods. Toward this end, we propose an analytical framework that clearly distinguishes among goals, indicators, targets, trends, driving forces, and policy responses. We also highlight the need for continued research on scale, aggregation, critical limits, and thresholds.},

  abstract = {Background: Pay for Performance (P4P) mechanisms to health facilities and providers have been implemented in several low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) to improve maternal and child health (MCH). These are tied to predetermined quality and quantity indicators. There is limited synthesized information on the structural, institutional and organizational factors that influence the success of P4P programmes with respect to quality of care. This review, which builds on a previously published review sets out to synthesize existing literature on the factors that influence the outcome of P4P programmes and quality of care. Methods: A literature review was conducted of published studies documenting implementation of P4P interventions and quality of care in low and middle income countries. Records published between June 2014 and September 2017 were selected and combined with articles from January 1990 to June 2014 previously identified by colleagues. Results: 13 studies were included in the final analysis. The majority of studies found a positive impact on quality of care scores and at least one study showed significant reductions in mortality outcomes in newborns. One study from Afghanistan did not show any positive effects. Structural factors associated with likely success of P4P programmes included: explicit acceptance and understanding by health workers; limiting the number of indicators measured with inputs from health workers. Organisational factors included sufficient incentive payments. Notably the main positive outcome identified was facility financial autonomy from additional payments. Verification by external assessors revealed no major manipulation to achieve payment trigger levels. The primary institutional factors identified that P4P programmes fared better when introduced alongside other health reforms and increased funding. Conclusions: This review has found that P4P is not a uniform intervention, but rather a range of approaches with a substantial variation and complexity in how programmes incorporate quality of care considerations. P4P has shown to have an impact on the quality of a number of limited aspects of maternal and child health care. Further research is needed to understand whether additional aspects of the quality of MCH care could be positively influenced by P4P programmes and how health worker motivation and acceptance are linked to this.},

Given the central logic of race and racism in European colonialism, and the decolonial argument that colonialism continues in the production and value of knowledge, I examine the presence and absence of race and racism in discussions of decolonising higher education and in development studies. Through a systematic review and content analysis of papers published in six major development studies journals over the past 13 years, I identify where and how race is present in current development scholarship and explore the implications of this for a decolonial turn in development studies.},

First, we select a group of in-field decision makers and collect their concrete information needs in the disaster aftermath. We then review to what extent existing data and tools can already address these needs. We conclude that existing solutions fall short in meeting important information needs of the selected group. We describe the design of an information system prototype to address these gaps more accurately. We combine data of the International Aid Transparency Initiative and the Humanitarian Data Exchange to form the data-backend of our system. We describe our implementation approach and evaluation plan.},

We identify trade freedom, monetary freedom and freedom from corruption as the most important indicators of economic freedom for growth in transition countries over the period 1994â€“2007. Some of the factors associated with faster growth prior to the crisis were associated with greater declines in growth during the first years of the financial crisis (2008â€“2009).},

  abstract = {Times of economic uncertainty, civil unrest and disaster are linked to a myriad of risk factors for increased violence against women and children (VAW/C). Pandemics are no exception. In fact, the regional or global nature and associated fear and uncertainty associated with pandemics provide an enabling environment that may exacerbate or spark diverse forms of violence. Understanding mechanisms underlying these dynamics are important for crafting policy and program responses to mitigate adverse effects. Based on existing published and grey literature, we document nine main (direct and indirect) pathways linking pandemics and VAW/C, through effects of (on):(1) economic insecurity and poverty-related stress, (2) quarantines and social isolation, (3) disaster and conflict-related unrest and instability, (4) exposure to exploitative relationships due to changing demographics, (5) reduced health service availability and access to first responders, (6) inability of women to temporarily escape abusive partners, (7) virus-specific sources of violence, (8) exposure to violence and coercion in response efforts, and (9) violence perpetrated against health care workers. We also suggest additional pathways with limited or anecdotal evidence likely to effect smaller sub-groups. Based on these mechanisms, we suggest eight policy and program responses for action by governments, civil society, international and community-based organizations. Finally, as research linking pandemics directly to diverse forms of VAW/C is scarce, we lay out a research agenda comprising three main streams, to better (1) understand the magnitude of the problem, (2) elucidate mechanisms and linkages with other social and economic factors and (3) inform intervention and response options. We hope this paper can be used by researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to help inform further evidence generation and policy action while situating VAW/C within the broader need for intersectional gender- and feminist-informed pandemic response.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} In a globalised world, the transfer of carbon between regions, either physically or embodied in production, represents a substantial fraction of global carbon emissions. The resulting emission transfers are important for balancing regional carbon budgets and for understanding the drivers of emissions. In this paper we synthesise current understanding in two parts: (1) CO\textsubscript{2} emissions embodied in goods and services that are produced in one country but consumed in others, and (2) carbon physically present in fossil fuels, petroleum-derived products, harvested wood products, crops, and livestock products. We describe the key differences between studies and provide a consistent set of estimates using the same definitions, modelling framework, and consistent data. We find the largest trade flows of carbon in international trade in 2004 were fossil fuels (2673 MtC, 37 \% of global emissions), CO\textsubscript{2} embodied in traded goods and services (1661 MtC, 22 \% of global emissions), crops (522 MtC, 31 \% of total harvested crop carbon), petroleum-based products (183 MtC, 50 \% of their total production), harvested wood products (149 MtC, 40 \% of total roundwood extraction), and livestock products (28 MtC, 22 \% of total livestock carbon). We find that for embodied CO\textsubscript{2} emissions, estimates from independent studies are robust, and that differences between individual studies are not a reflection of the uncertainty in consumption-based estimates, but rather these differences result from the use of different production-based emissions input data and different definitions for allocating emissions to international trade. After adjusting for these issues, results across independent studies converge to give less uncertainty than previously assumed. For physical carbon flows there are relatively few studies to be synthesised, but differences between existing studies are due to the method of allocating to international trade, with some studies using "apparent consumption" as opposed to "final consumption". While results across studies are sufficiently robust to be used in further applications, more research is needed to understand differences and to harmonise definitions for particular applications.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

One of the possible instruments through which both issues may be approached simultaneously is a multistakeholder partnership, a form of governance with the potential to address existing regulatory, participation, resource and learning gaps as it harnesses the strengths of private, public, and nonprofit partners. There is some insight into partnerships for climate change, but largely limited to developed countries, and those in developing countries most often do not involve companies. To help fill this gap, this article explores the role of multistakeholder partnerships in addressing climate change and sustainable development in developing-country settings. It elaborates on the governance function of partnerships, on actor involvement, the gaps addressed, as well as synergies and trade-offs in the climate change-sustainable development nexus and how partnerships may help address them. As the number of such partnerships is still limited, we discuss seven illustrative partnerships and draw conclusions as to further conceptualizations and implications for research and practice.},

  abstract = {Globalisation is blamed for many socioeconomic shortcomings. I discuss the consequences of globalisation by surveying the empirical globalisation literature. My focus is on the KOF indices of globalisation that have been used in more than 100 studies. Early studies using the KOF index reported correlations between globalisation and several outcome variables. Studies published more recently identify causal effects. The evidence shows that globalisation has spurred economic growth, promoted gender equality and improved human rights. Moreover, globalisation did not erode welfare state activities, did not have any significant effect on labour market interaction and hardly influenced market deregulation. It increased, however, within-country income inequality. The consequences of globalisation thus turn out to be overall much more favourable than often conjectured in the public discourse.},

  abstract = {China, in its quest for a closer strategic partnership with Africa, has increasingly dynamic economic, political and diplomatic activities on the continent. Chinese leaders and strategists believe that Chinaâ€™s historical experience and vision of economic development resonates powerfully with African counterparts and that the long standing history of friendly political linkages and development co-operation offers a durable foundation for future partnership. In doing so, we see from the Chinese side and amongst some western commentators a form of exceptionalism and generalisation regarding both China and Africa. In this paper instead we seek to develop theoretical tools for examining China as a geopolitical and geoeconomic actor that is both different and similar to other industrial powers intervening in Africa. This is premised on a political economy approach that ties together material interests with a deconstruction of the discursive or â€˜extra-economicâ€™ ways by which Chinese capitalism internationalises. From there we use this framework to analyse contemporary Chinese engagement in Africa. We examine the changing historical position of Africa within Beijingâ€™s foreign policy strategy and Chinaâ€™s vision of the evolving international political system, looking in particular at Chinaâ€™s bilateral and state-centric approach to working with African â€˜partnersâ€™. Chinese practice is uncomfortable and unfamiliar with the notion of â€˜developmentâ€™ as an independent policy field of the kind that emerged among Western nations in the course of the 1950s and increasingly China has come to be viewed as a â€˜rogue creditorâ€™ and a threat to the international aid industry. Rather than highlighting one strand of Chinese relations with African states (such as aid or governance) we propose here that it is necessary to critically reflect on the wider geopolitics of China-Africa relations (past and present) in order to understand how China is opening up new â€˜choicesâ€™ and altering the playing field for African development for the first time since the neo-liberal turn of the 1980s.},

  abstract = {In urban slums â€“ home to approximately 1 billion people worldwide - access to clean drinking water is woefully inadequate despite the United Nations' declaration that access to safe water is a fundamental human right. Households in slums are frequently forced to rely on multiple drinking water sources to meet their needs. Numerous factors influence choice of water source, including water quality, availability, reliability, and affordability. These factors are not temporally static, but instead vary over multiple timescales (from sub-daily changes to annual changes and beyond) in response to changes in the water source itself and changes in the household's ability to use that source. For example, the cost of water can may change over time in response to water availability (e.g. rainy season versus dry season) and a slum household's ability to pay for water may change over time in response to changes in household income. However, existing national and global monitoring of safe water access, including Sustainable Development Goal 6, overlook these temporal dynamics of water access, quality and health risk in slums. This paper proposes a research agenda for exploring temporal changes in drinking water access and quality in urban slums and their potential influence on health risk. It argues that in the design of research studies, policy interventions, and drinking water monitoring aimed at improving access and health in urban slums, temporal dynamics should be considered over at least three interlinked time scales: short-term (from sub-daily to week-to-week), medium-term (from month-to-month to season-to-season) and long-term (from year-to-year). The paper concludes with recommendations for future research on temporal dynamics of drinking water and health in slums.},

These calculations are based on the empirical relationship between grades completed and ability to read, a descriptive â€˜learning profile.â€™ The large literature on schooling and life outcomes suggests simple correlations are a reasonable guide to causal effects, and the typical concern is over-estimation of the true return to schooling â€“ implying our calculations using a descriptive and not causal learning profile are a best-case scenario. This best case is often not at all good: the learning profile is so weak in Nigeria that even if all women had completed grade six, adult female illiteracy would only have fallen from 58 percent to 53 percent. In contrast, children in many other countries do learn to read in much higher numbers and enrolling out-of-school girls would dramatically reduce illiteracy. For instance, in Ethiopia the same calculations yield a reduction in illiteracy from 82 to 25 percent. But across nearly fifty developing countries with available data our calculations suggest 40 percent of women would be illiterate even if all women completed at least grade six. Achieving new Sustainable Development Goal targets of universal literacy and numeracy will require both achievement of universal schooling and dramatic improvements in the learning profile in most developing countries.},

In addition, it depicts the cyclical patterns of political activity dealing with sustainability and identifies the main sustainability goals and targets endorsed by several political initiatives. These tasks are accomplished through a literature review and an assessment of indicators dealing with political will. It is concluded that global sustainability governance followed an intermittent path characterized by two periods of significant accomplishments (until 1979; 1987â€“1995) and by two others less successful (1980â€“1986; 1995 onwards, interrupted by a peak around 2000). Peaks in political activity coincide with the decennial Earth Summits, suggesting their major influence as catalysts of more profound societal and political action. Sustainability concerns and goals shifted from an emphasis on pollution control and availability of natural resources to a more balanced position that puts human development at the center.

This brave new world of solving pressing problems through machine learning has several dark sides. A data divide is being created that leaves the most vulnerable populations out of the solutions being created while discriminating against those whose data is churned by obscure algorithms. Complex mathematical models together with computing algorithms produce scores that are used to evaluate the lives of the masses. These systems have scaled to enormous proportions, changing lives by affecting credit scores, job prospects and access to healthcare. The promise of fairness, transparency, cost-effectiveness and efficiency gives rise to powerful scoring algorithms that have the power to create mass devastation while discriminating against the most vulnerable. Questions arise as to: What injustices (types of injustice) are created by datafication of development? how can the injustices caused by the extraction, analysis and commoditization of data be alleviated? Who has access to and what is being done with private data? And for whose benefit or purpose is personal data being extracted? Such questions are explored through the contributions in on data justice, the use of ICTs by micro-Entrepreneurs, mobile money and financial inclusion offered through papers in this issue.},

However, scanty attention has been drawn towards the effect of current account balance on unemployment rate despite the arguments from different quarters trailing such relationship. By employing Autoregressive Distribution Lag estimation technique, this study specifically focuses on the short-run dynamic and long-run effects of trade openness and current account balance on unemployment rate in Nigeria using the data that span 1981-2014. We found that trade openness worsens unemployment rate both in the short-run and long run. We also discovered that in the short run, current account balance increases unemployment rate but reduces it in the long run. Control variables used in the study such as inflation rate, exchange rate, and FDI followed a priori expectation while real GDP, wages and government consumption expenditure failed to follow a priori expectation. We, therefore, concluded that there is need for sound trade and macroeconomic policies to aid domestic firmsâ€™ production to ensure international competitiveness of these firms so as to guarantee employment generation.},

First, it deals with the effects of openness to trade, foreign direct investment, and financial crises on average wages. Second, it discusses the impact of exposure to world markets on the dispersion of wages by occupation, skill, and gender. Third, it describes the pattern of job destruction and job creation associated with globalization. Because these two processes are not synchronized, the fourth issue addressed is the impact on unemployment rates. Fifth, the paper reviews the labor market policies that can be used to offset the adverse effects of globalization on employment and labor earnings. Finally, it discusses how the international community could encourage developing countries to adopt sound labor market policies in the context of globalization.},

In line with current efforts to â€˜decolonise development studiesâ€™, we critically reflect on the underlying assumptions of this line of thinking. We establish a framework that differentiates between potential positive and negative fungibility. We hypothesise that recipient governments can redirect their own funds and achieve positive fungibility, if (1) the marginal value added in the alternative target sector/region is higher; (2) equity concerns are adequately addressed when other sectors/regions are supported; and (3) temporal delay helps to cushion instability of aid flows. There are indications that this positive fungibility might be quite prevalent. Future fungibility research should therefore no longer assume that fungibility is in itself undesirable.},

  abstract = {We systematically reviewed current climate change literature in order to examine how multiple processes that affect human vulnerability have been studied. Of the 125 reviewed articles, 79 \% were published after 2009. There are numerous concepts that point out to stressors other than climate change that were used in reviewed studies. These different concepts were used interchangeably, and they illustrate processes that act on different scales. Most widely used concepts included non-climatic (40 \% of the articles), multiple stressors (38 \%) and other factors (37 \%). About 75 \% of the studies either acknowledged or carefully analyzed the social and environmental context in which vulnerability is experienced. One-third of the studies recognized climate change-related stressors as the most important, one-third argued that stressors other than climate are more important, and the rest of the studies did not analyze the relative importance of the different processes. Interactions between different stressors were mentioned in 76 \% and analyzed explicitly in 28 \% of the articles. Our review shows that there are studies that analyze the social context of vulnerability within climate change-related literature and this literature is rapidly expanding. Reviewed studies point out that there are multiple interacting stressors, whose interlinkages need to be carefully analyzed and targeted by policies, which integrate adaptation to climate change and other stressors. In conclusion, we suggest that future studies should include analytical frameworks that reflect dissimilarities between different types of stressors, methodological triangulation to identify key stressors and analysis of interactions between multiple stressors across different scales.},

  abstract = {This paper provides a review of the literature on the development impact of migration and remittances on origin countries and on destination countries in the South. International migration is an ever-growing phenomenon that has important development implications for both sending and receiving countries. For a sending country, migration and the resulting remittances lead to increased incomes and poverty reduction, and improved health and educational outcomes, and promote economic development. Yet these gains might come at substantial social costs to the migrants and their families. Since many developing countries are also large recipients of international migrants, they face challenges of integration of immigrants, job competition between migrant and native workers, and fiscal costs associated with provision of social services to the migrants. This paper also summarizes incipient discussions on the impacts of migration on climate change, democratic values, demographics, national identity, and security. In conclusion, the paper highlights a few policy recommendations calling for better integration of migration in development policies in the South and the North, improving data collection on migration and remittance flows, leveraging remittances for improving access to finance of recipient households and countries, improving recruitment mechanisms, and facilitating international labor mobility through safe and legal channels.},

However, it would take only small adverse shifts in the world distribution of consumption to eliminate the gains to the poor from growth.},

A welfarist interpretation of global poverty lines is augmented by the idea of normative functionings, the cost of which varies across countries. In this light, current absolute measures are seen to ignore important social effects on welfare, while popular, strongly relative measures ignore absolute levels of living. It is argued that a new hybrid measure is called for, combining absolute and weakly relative measures consistent with how national lines vary across countries. Illustrative calculations indicate that we are seeing a falling incidence of poverty globally over the past 30 years. This is mainly due to lower absolute poverty counts in the developing world. While fewer people are poor by the global absolute standard, more are poor by the country-specific relative standard. The vast bulk of poverty, both absolute and relative, is now found in the developing world.},

  abstract = {This paper rejects the characterization of globalization as an autonomous and irresistible process driven by the impersonal forces of the market and technical progress. Whether domestic or global, market forces are shaped and controlled by policy choices and the institutional frameworks in which they are made. In the absence of adequate institutional frameworks and productive capacities, rapid liberalization is as likely to lead to stagnation and unemployment as to growth and rising incomes per head. We show that the major economic forces presumed to be crucial for spreading the benefits of globalization have been less global than often presented, have proved to be much weaker than widely predicted and carry potentially damaging effects as well as benefits. Accordingly, and without denying that by the late 1970s many developing countries needed to find new ways of inserting themselves into the international economy, we argue that the new policy orientation of macroeconomic stringency, downsizing the public sector and the rapid opening of developing country markets to foreign trade and capital after the debt crisis, has failed to produce an economic environment that supports faster economic growth and strengthens productivity performance. In suggesting the outlines of a more strategic approach to economic development the emphasis is on the need for domestic investment to be mobilized as the basis for industrialization and for a gradual approach to integration with the global economy.},

This paper contributes to this line of inquiry by assessing gender differences in morbidity across five major US racial and ethnic populations. Using data from the 1997â€“2001 waves of the National Health Interview Survey, the analysis examines differences in men and women's self-rated health, functional limitations, and life-threatening medical conditions for whites, blacks, Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, and Cubans. For each health outcome, we investigate the utility of socioeconomic factors in accounting for observed disparities. Contrary to finding universal excess in female morbidity, the results show that the magnitude of gender difference varies considerably by racial/ethnic group, health outcome, and comparison category. The most striking findings are the consistently higher levels of functional limitations for all women compared to men in their same racial/ethnic group and the poorer health of black women relative to both white and black men for all health measures, after adjustment for socioeconomic and background factors. The gender gap for all other health measures is more variable, and for Mexican women a difference is only evident for functional limitations and only when compared to Mexican men. Our results underscore the need for more research on the role of race and ethnicity in shaping gendered health inequalities and the mechanisms that lead to such variable patterns of difference across and within US racial and ethnic populations.},

It argues that the superficial consensus that has characterized much of the early debate has given way to a series of parallel but distinct discourses around sustainability. The underlying assumptions behind much of the discussion are assessed, as is the move, after the first Earth Summit (1992), to focus on rights, rather than needs, as the principal line of enquiry. This analytical attention to rights is linked to the neo-liberal economic agendas of the 1990s, and the growth of interest in congruent areas, including human security and the environment, social capital, critical natural capital and intellectual property rights. The paper argues that increasing attention to questions of biology and science studies has strengthened this â€˜rights-basedâ€™ approach, as well as interest in the linkages between â€˜naturalâ€™ and â€˜humanâ€™ systems, including attention to questions of environmental justice. It is clear that issues of global environmental justice are as important as they were when the concept of â€˜sustainable developmentâ€™ was in its infancy, but the new material realities of science and the environment in the 21st century demand a re-engagement with their social consequences, something which is largely ignored by the (market) liberal consensus.

As health providers, we are often taught that â€˜taking a historyâ€™ is a critical component of a patient consultation to ensure that the underlying conditions are treated rather than the often superficial presenting symptoms. In the same way, attempts to make sense of the health and well-being of Indigenous peoples is inadequate unless health providers engage critically with the history of their respective nations and any subsequent patterns of privilege or disadvantage. Understanding this history, within the framework of western imperialism and other similar colonial projects, allows us to make sense of international patterns of Indigenous health status. While health commentators acknowledge the unequal health outcomes of Indigenous people, and an increasing number also link these inequities to Indigenous marginalisation resulting from historic events, very few go further and expose the deep relationship between racism and coloniality and how these continue to be the basic determinants of Indigenous health today. This work includes honest examination of the role that science and the health disciplines have played historically in colonisation through the subjugation of Indigenous ways of knowing and knowledge production, as well as being complicit in the creation and maintenance of a fabricated hierarchy of humankind. Despite the â€˜scienceâ€™ of this racial hierarchy being discredited, it retains a false validity in our societies. As long as oppressive systems that continue to re-inscribe racism and white privilege remain in communities, including our academic communities, coloniality continues its discrimination. Indigenous voices on migration, ethnicity, racisma and health will always demand the elimination of inequities in health but to do so will require a parallel commitment to critically interrogating all of our histories and our disciplines, as well as examining how our practice, including research, disrupts or maintains global systems of racism and coloniality.},

  abstract = {Over the past two decades, earmarked funding to international development organizations through special-purpose trust funds has increased greatly. This paper studies the incentives for trust funds from the perspective of multilateral agencies, notably the World Bank. A theoretically intriguing type of funds are so-called â€œpass-on funds,â€ in which one unit hosts the fund, then passes on its resources to another type of unit for implementation. Each unit has different preferences for the specific types of activities to be supported by the fund. Interviews with World Bank staff and complementary documents demonstrate the rationale for pass-on funds and the associated division of labor between fundraising network units and implementing regional units. While pass-on funds reflect an efficient division of labor between functionally specialized units, they increase the misalignment between sector-specific global priorities and country-specific needs. Organizational reform drove the sudden explosion of pass-on funds around the millennium turn, facilitated by growing availability of donor monies for specific sectors and by lenient internal regulation. Organizational reform undermined budget autonomy of sector units, causing those units to seek new funds in their areas of expertise. A number of reform features also reduced administrative budgets of country units, increasing their demand for pass-on funding grants. The results contribute to the emerging literature on earmarked funding and highlight the need to consider international organizations as heterogeneous actors.},

Reflecting the variety of trust fund purposes and related governance arrangements, an emergent literature emphasizes a diversity of reasons underlying this growth. This paper proposes a simple â€“ yet encompassing â€“ explanation applicable to all kinds of funds: donors use trust funds to wield â€˜influenceâ€™ â€“ leveraging financial resources to alter the policies of multilateral organizations. Based on interviews at the World Bank, the study shows that influence is a dominant motive behind trust funds, though the capacity and willingness to wield influence varies across donors. Influence is a salient motive especially for medium-sized donors and emerging donors but surprisingly less so for large donors. In addition, attempts of influence are most effective when donors promote new thematic issues that did not previously feature Bank assistance and outside established programs. Concerns among stakeholders about undue donor influence are highest with respect to the global knowledge work of the World Bank but are virtually absent when involving donors in the operational activities at the country level.},

  abstract = {Since the Adaptation Fund (AF) became operational in 2007, there has been a vivid discussion about equity and efficiency in how resources (predicted to be scarce) are governed and allocated. One complicating factor is that allocation is often discussed between countries rather than between sub-national causes and groups, and while this approach follows from the UNFCCC context, it is problematic because it ignores the fact that vulnerability is a locally contextualized phenomenon. This paper empirically analyses the portrayal of vulnerability and adaptation benefits in project proposals approved by the AF, and thereby comments on the normative principles of equity and efficiency when allocating funds to developing countries and their vulnerable communities. It does this by evaluating actual decisions made by the AF, which has been operating for some time. We qualitatively analyse all proposals approved as of December 2012 by the Fund's Board. First, we compare the ways that â€˜particular vulnerabilityâ€™ is justified or not, especially in light of the minimal guidance available. Second, we compare project proponent's statements (or lack thereof) on economic, social, and environmental benefits arising from the suggested projects, and who they would accrue to. Lessons learned with regard to allocation will also be important for the development of the Green Climate Fund, considering that resources are likely to be scarce for some time in comparison with predicted funding needs.},

This paper focuses on the fact that the IMF may favour geopolitically important countries in the distribution of IMF loans, differentiating between concessional and non-concessional facilities. To carry out the empirical analysis, we construct a new database that compiles a wide array of proxies for geopolitical importance for 107 IMF countries over 1990â€“2003, focusing on emerging and developing economies. We use a factor analysis to capture the common underlying characteristic of countries' geopolitical importance as well as a potential analysis since we also want to account for the geographical situation of the loan recipients. While controlling for economic and political determinants, our results show that geopolitical factors influence notably lending decisions when loans are non-concessional, whereas results are less robust and in opposite direction for concessional loans. This study provides empirical support to the view that geopolitical considerations are an important factor in shaping IMF lending decisions, potentially affecting the institution's effectiveness and credibility.},

Poor measurement hampers current research efforts, and improving empowerment measurement is a frequently identified research priority. However, a discussion of specific steps researchers can take to improve upon common measurement practices is lacking. The purpose of this paper is to provide quantitative researchers recommendations to measure womenâ€™s empowerment in a theory-based, precise, and comprehensive way. This paper reviewed key theoretical concepts of womenâ€™s empowerment and critically reviewed common measurement approaches. Three broad recommendations for measuring empowerment emerged from this critical review, and specific suggestions to meet these recommendations are discussed. First, researchers should draw upon theory to construct measurement models (e.g., using theory to construct dimensions of empowerment and selection of indicators). Second, researchers should use analytic methods that minimize implicit judgments and bias (e.g., not classifying women as empowered using specific criteria). Third, researchers should collect comprehensive empowerment information (e.g., supplementing quantitative measures with qualitative interviews to learn how and why changes took place). Measuring empowerment poses a number of challenges, and this review provides researchers suggestions to improve upon common measurement practices. Improved measurement will strengthen research efforts on the causes and consequences of poor empowerment, which has the potential to improve the well-being of women and their children.},

We assess the extent of the multidimensionality of poverty using the original Alkireâ€“Foster measure of multidimensional poverty. We then make estimates of the global profile of multidimensional poverty in 2015 using the Alkireâ€“Foster measure and two alternative indices. We conclude that the worldâ€™s multidimensionally poor are largely young people, residing in rural areas though not necessarily working in agriculture. Overall, the contribution of the paper is to explain how multidimensional poverty indices differ; and to present a new set of estimates of the global multidimensional poverty profile for 2015.},

An important marker in this intellectual terrain is the World BankÂ’s Economic Growth in the 1990s: Learning from a Decade of Reform (2005).With its emphasis on humility, policy diversity, selective and modest reforms, and experimentation, this is a rather extraordinary document demonstrating the extent to which the thinking of the development policy community has been transformed over the years. But there are other competing perspectives as well. One (trumpeted elsewhere in Washington) puts faith on extensive institutional reform, and another (exemplified by the U.N. Millennium Report) puts faith on foreign aid. Sorting intelligently among these diverse perspectives requires an explicitly diagnostic approach that recognizes that the binding constraints on growth differ from setting to setting.},

Though the localisation agenda is at the core of current reform efforts in the humanitarian sector, the debate lacks a critical discussion of underlying assumptions â€“ most strikingly, the very conceptualisation of the local itself. It is argued that the current discourse is dominated by a problematic conceptualisation of the local in binary opposition to the international, leading to blind spots in the analysis of exclusionary practices of the humanitarian sector. As such the localisation agenda risks perpetuating the very issues it wants to redress. A critical localism is thus proposed as a framework for much needed research on the localisation agenda.},

At the same time, the pandemic risks aggravating existing pressures on ODA which may erode its credibility and the volume of public concessional, cross-border resources made available for development purposes. We revisit the evolution of ODA and discuss three such pressures: ODA/GNI ratio targets threaten ODA budgets when GNI is falling in many donor countries; flawed new rules on scoring debt relief as ODA will lead to large-scale doublecounting just as debt relief looks ever more likely; and the increasingly-blurred boundary between global public goods and traditional ODA may allow the former to displace the latter. We discuss ways in which the Development Assistance Committee has sought to mitigate these pressures in the past, and conclude that alternative strategies may be required. To this end, we recommend that the DAC rolls back its new debt relief rules, considers an additional target tier for â€œbeyond ODAâ€ spend on global public goods, and commits to greater transparency and developing country participation in its financial metric-setting processes.},

Using a systematic framework focused on compliance, efficiency, and effectiveness, I analyze the Kyoto Protocol and argue it is a clear case of institutional failure, with the design itself bearing substantial blame for this outcome. The study points to how particular features of the Protocolâ€”its short time frame for action, binding targets, emission reduction measures, and provision for future commitment periodsâ€”have resulted in short-sighted behavior by member states and path-dependent structures that failed to make a substantial impact on the climate problem.

  abstract = {Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), principally ischemic heart disease (IHD) and stroke, are the leading cause of global mortality and a major contributor to disability. This paper reviews the magnitude of total CVD burden, including 13 underlying causes of cardiovascular death and 9 related risk factors, using estimates from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2019. GBD, an ongoing multinational collaboration to provide comparable and consistent estimates of population health over time, used all available population-level data sources on incidence, prevalence, case fatality, mortality, and health risks to produce estimates for 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2019. Prevalent cases of total CVD nearly doubled from 271 million (95\% uncertainty interval [UI]: 257 to 285~million)~in~1990 to 523 million (95\% UI: 497 to 550 million) in 2019, and the number of CVD deaths steadily increased from 12.1 million (95\% UI:11.4 to 12.6 million) in 1990, reaching 18.6 million (95\% UI: 17.1 to 19.7 million) in 2019. The global trends for disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and years of life lost also increased significantly, and years lived with disability doubled from 17.7 million (95\% UI: 12.9 to 22.5 million) to 34.4 million (95\% UI:24.9 to 43.6 million) over that period. The total number of DALYs due to IHD has risen steadily since 1990, reaching 182 million (95\% UI: 170 to 194 million) DALYs, 9.14 million (95\% UI: 8.40 to 9.74 million) deaths in the year 2019, and 197 million (95\% UI: 178 to 220 million) prevalent cases of IHD in 2019. The total number of DALYs due to stroke has risen steadily since 1990, reaching 143 million (95\% UI: 133 to 153 million) DALYs, 6.55 million (95\% UI: 6.00 to 7.02 million) deaths in the year 2019, and 101 million (95\% UI: 93.2 to 111 million) prevalent cases of stroke in~2019. Cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of disease burden in the world. CVD burden continues its decades-long rise for almost all countries outside high-income countries, and alarmingly, the age-standardized rate of CVD has begun to rise in some locations where it was previously declining in high-income countries. There is an urgent need to focus on implementing existing cost-effective policies and interventions if the world is to meet the targets for Sustainable Development Goal 3 and achieve a 30\% reduction in premature mortality due to noncommunicable diseases.},

While services account for about 50\% of world trade in value added terms, services trade policies are often restrictive and multinational commitments are generally modest. Taking steps to raise the profile of services trade within government policy-making would help close this gap and highlight the contribution of services trade policy to a wide range of broader national objectives that have an important services dimension, whether small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) and gender policy, or the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).}{$<$}br{$><$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Background: In 1994, the African National Congress identified early childhood development as a potential strategy to redress the inequalities of apartheid, however, two and a half decades later, poverty still persists, and South Africa is one of the most unequal countries in the world.Aim: This article explores how policy texts based on and with the use of certain data practices establish â€˜truthsâ€™ about childhoods and society, construct families and communities, and determine forms of provision to address inequality.Setting: In 2015, the South African government published the National Integrated Early Childhood Policy (NIECDP) to continue to address poverty and inequality. Its implementation increasingly draws on data practices that measure and inform solutions. The use of data practices, while also providing needed information, prioritises solutions that proceed in technocratic ways instead of facilitating social change.Methods: With a critical discourse analysis of policy texts and the introduction of alternatives, the analysis seeks to highlight the power and knowledge hierarchies that construct the policies of NIECDP.Results: This article demonstrates how discourses and data practices prioritise â€˜the government of povertyâ€™ instead of helping to eliminate it and silence the voices of those living with poverty. This form of government through data also undermines the policyâ€™s potential to respond to the different life chances resulting from the diverse conditions in which young children live in South Africa.Conclusion: This article seeks to re-open a debate that the NIECDP successfully silenced, specifically who benefits, who speaks and who is silenced.},

  abstract = {The Sustainable Development Goals agreed by the United Nations in September 2015 comprise 17 goals and 169 targets aimed at integrating matters related to sustainable development into the overall economic, environmental and social frameworks of countries. Whereas the SDGs have a global dimension, their action implementation depends on the level of priority different countries give to them, and on how sustainability issues compete with a country's main problems. The aim of this paper was to identify the main Sustainable Development Goals approached by experts from different geographic regions, according to their experience and research area, and to discuss the relation between these goals and the main local issues and challenges of each region. The methodology starts with snowball sampling to collect information from experts from all geographic regions, through contact networks of universities in different countries. With the information about the goals researched by the participating experts, an analysis of the relation between the study focus and the geographical regions of origin was conducted. A total of 266 specialists from North America, Latin America/Caribbean, Africa, Asia, Europe and Oceania participated in the survey. Based on the sample used, it can be said that there is a relation between the local problems or challenges observed in some regions and the main areas of interest of the surveyed experts, with a general emphasis on the study of goals 4, 11 and 13. Based on the data gathered, the paper presents a set of examples of positive and negative situations in the various regions, and considers the extent to which some Sustainable Development Goals are being pursued by research on a worldwide basis.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: This descriptive finding examines excess deaths following Hurricane MarÃ­a, in Puerto Rico for September and October 2017. OBJECTIVE: We seek to determine the degree of excess deaths in Puerto Rico based on historical patterns of variability in deaths by month for the 2010-2016 period and using estimation techniques. METHODS:  Data for this study come from death records from the Puerto Rico Vital Statistics system. We aggregated data by month and year (2010-2016) and produced means (expected deaths) and 95\% confidence intervals (C.I., or patterns of variability) for each month. Using public statements from the Puerto Rico Department of Public Safety, we estimate the number of deaths for September and October 2017 and compare it to the level of expected deaths considering the pattern of variability. RESULTS: Expected deaths for September and October were 2,383 (95\% C.I. 2,296-2,469) and 2,428 (95\% C.I. 2,380 - 2,476), respectively. Estimates for total deaths, for September and October 2017 were 2,987 (95\% CI 2,900-3,074) and 3,043 (95\% C.I. 2,995-3,091), respectively. The difference between our estimates and the upper 95\% CI for the average deaths is 518 deaths for September and 567 deaths for October. CONCLUSIONS: The mortality burden may higher than official counts, and may exceed the current official death toll by a factor of 10 or more.},

It is usually suggested that FLFP rises whenever trade expands those sectors which use female labor intensively. This paper develops a theoretical model to argue that, quite surprisingly, the opposite effects can occur. Distinguishing between female intensive sectors (FIS) and male intensive sectors (MIS), we show that FLFP may actually fall if trade expands FIS. When FIS are capital intensive, trade integration of a capital-abundant economy expands FIS and contracts MIS. Consequently, male workers migrate from MIS to FIS, diluting the capitalâ€“labor ratio in the FIS. Under a high complementarity between capital and female labor, the marginal productivity of women drops more than that of men. Thus, the gender wage gap widens and FLFP falls. Employment patterns in the U.S. following NAFTA are broadly consistent with our theory.},

  abstract = {Since 2008, the leaders of industrialised and emerging economies have engaged in steering the global economy through the G20. Divergent national positions were to be expected based upon the different stages of economic development and according to previously existing international groups. The actual controversies in the G20 did not reflect these patterns, however, but showed divergence both between industrialised countries and between emerging economies. In explaining this puzzle, I argue that the driving forces for global economic governance have ceased to be industrialised or emerging countries' alliances and levels of development. Rather, the causes for the positions of G20 members can be found in economic interests and ideas dominant in the domestic politics of countries. These societal influences shape governmental preference formation in both industrialised and emerging countries and consequently influence their behaviour in global governance. The resulting divergences weaken previously existing groups such as the G7 and the BRICs, and create a new pattern in world politics. This societal approach to explaining governmental positions in global economic governance is exemplified on the core G20 issues of stimulus/public debt and global imbalances/exchange rates.},

Trade can contribute to meeting those goals, but only if the policies are adapted accordingly. Given that they largely build on existing international commitments, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are not demanding revolutionary change. But it is an important step forward that the Agenda lays out a comprehensive programme for all policy areas, indicating what would be required to achieve sustainability at all levels. Especially in developed countries, there is widespread criticism that trade policy and globalisation worsen inequalities within and between states, endanger ecological stability and social security, and perpetuate unsustainable patterns of consumption. Implementing the SDGs would also represent a constructive response to these justified criticisms of globalisation. (author's abstract)},

Hundreds of alternative measurement systems have been proposed to measure sustainable development. This paper argues for harmonization of these methods, and facilitates this discussion by providing a detailed comparison of countryâ€level measures. The analysis includes 55 systems (12 composite indicators and 43 sustainable development indicator (SDI) sets). The analysis shows that SDI sets are more common than composite indicators. This paper also shows that composite indicators generally focus on environmental themes, while SDI sets are broader in scope through inclusion of more social themes. Overall, we find a great degree of agreement on the most popular indicators and themes in SDI sets. However, we do find that certain indicators are more prevalent in higher and lower income countries. The article emphasizes the need for harmonization of measurement systems, but also shows the importance of flexibility at the country level.

In most cases of misuse, the GDI was wrongly interpreted as a measure of gender inequality. Due to the many misinterpretations, the potential policy impact the GDI and GEM can have seems limited.},

  abstract = {The CSIS Economics Program is tracking commitments, approvals, and disbursements by major international financial institutions (IFIs) to meet the massive financing needs generated by the Covid-19 pandemic and its economic fallout. These IFIs include the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, and regional development banks. We also include select regional financing arrangements (RFAs), which, together with the IFIs, central bank bilateral swap lines, and individual countriesâ€™ foreign reserve holdings, comprise the Global Financial Safety Net (GFSN). Based on data as of July 14: We estimate IFIs have approved \$140.7 billion in Covid-19-related support since January 27, an increase of \$23.7 billion since our last data update on June 19. The IMF has approved \$82.8 billion, including emergency assistance and precautionary lines of credit, while the multilateral development banks (MDBs) combined have approved \$57.4 billion. Since our June update, the IMF approved three new programs totaling \$5.6 billion while MDBs approved \$18.0 billion in new funding.  We estimate IFIs have disbursed \$88.9 billion, about two-thirds of the amount approved. Reflecting the precautionary nature of a large portion of IMF support, the IMF has disbursed around 40 percent of its approved funding, or \$33 billion. MDBs have disbursed \$55.3 billion, or 96 percent of the total amount approved.  Regionally, the Americas have been the largest recipient of IFI approvals, while Asia/Oceania and Africa have received the most disbursements. IFIs have approved \$58.8 billion in funding for the Americas but have only disbursed \$12.9 billion, reflecting the three IMF precautionary Flexible Credit Lines with Colombia, Chile, and Peru. Asia/Oceania and Africa have received \$29.4 billion and \$27.8 billion in disbursements, respectively.  Amendments to the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization (CMIM) came into effect on June 23. Resources totaling about \$240 billion under the multilateral currency swap arrangement between the 10 Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member states, China, Japan, and South Korea have not yet been drawn; however, the recent amendments address issues around its use in relationship to IMF financing, suggesting the CMIM is in a better position to respond to membersâ€™ financing needs should they materialize. Of the five RFAs in our dataset, only the Arab Monetary Fund has approved and disbursed financial support in response to the current crisis.

  abstract = {This commentary is an updated version of one originally published April 13, 2020. Confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) exceed 3 million as of April 30 and continue to climb. To combat the virusâ€™ spread, governments have implemented restrictions on economic activity unprecedented in peacetime. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development estimates that containment measures will cause an initial decline in the level of output of 20 to 25 percent in many economies, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects negative global growth for 2020 with â€œthe worst economic fallout since the Great Depression.â€ In response to this unprecedented shock, governments have pledged massive economic support, from direct payments to individuals to â€œlimitlessâ€ loans for struggling businesses. At a March 26 virtual summit, leaders of the Group of Twenty (G20) major economies said they were spending over \$5 trillion, equivalent to 7.4 percent of 2019 G20 countriesâ€™ gross domestic product (GDP), to â€œcounteract the social, economic, and financial impacts of the pandemic.â€ Since then, G20 governments have added to this figure as the extent of the economic fallout has become clearer. Developed by the CSIS iDeas Lab. Data updated through April 29, 2020 The CSIS Simon Chair analyzed and categorized major fiscal actions taken by G20 countries to respond to the economic shock. Several key trends emerge: Fiscal support has increased since April 10: As of April 29, we estimate that G20 countries are providing \$6.3 trillion in fiscal support, representing 9.3 percent of 2019 G20 GDP. Of the total, \$3.2 trillion will support direct government spending (4.8 percent of 2019 G20 GDP), up from \$2.1 trillion (3.1 percent of GDP) as of April 10. Credit enhancements contribute \$2.3 trillion and tax relief another \$0.8 trillion. G20 loan guarantee frameworks alone exceed \$2 trillion: G20 economies, led by European countries, have announced loan guarantee frameworks exceeding \$2 trillion, representing 3 percent of 2019 G20 GDP. Given that many guarantee frameworks do not quantify ex ante fiscal outlays, we assign a 50 percent â€œfiscal costâ€ to guarantee figures resulting in our headline fiscal support figure of \$6.3 trillion. Assigning a 100 percent â€œfiscal costâ€ to loan guarantees would boost our headline figure to \$7.4 trillion, or 10.8 percent of GDP. Conversely, assigning zero â€œfiscal costâ€ to loan guarantees would lower our headline figure to \$5.3 trillion, or 7.8 percent of GDP. Emerging market (EM) economies have boosted spending but still lag advanced economy (AE) peers by a wide margin: G20 EM fiscal support as of April 29 averages 3.2 percent of GDP, an increase of 1.2 percentage points since April 10 but still well below the average of 11.6 percent for AEs. Chinaâ€™s announcement of 2.3 trillion yuan (\$326 billion) in local government special purpose bond issuance brings its fiscal response to 3.7 percent of GDP, still well below the amount provided during the global financial crisis. Initial data updated through April 10 show the following trends: The largest component of fiscal support is intended to provide financing to businesses: As of April 10, 2020, we estimate G20 countries to have pledged \$5.3 trillion in fiscal support, representing 7.8 percent of 2019 G20 GDP. Of the total, \$2.5 trillion will support credit enhancements (3.7 percent of 2019 G20 GDP), compared to \$2.1 trillion (3.1 percent of GDP) in direct government spending and \$0.6 trillion (0.9 percent) in tax relief. (Our analysis does not include tax deferments.) Almost all support focuses on keeping companies and individuals afloat rather than stimulating new demand and investment, which will become the priority when health restrictions ease. Direct government spending is higher than levels during the global financial crisis (GFC), so far: The 3.1 percent of G20 2019 GDP in direct government spending compares to 2.5 percent of G20 GDP in 2008-2009 â€œcrisis-related discretionary measuresâ€ in response to the GFC. By the end of the pandemic, G20 countries will likely have spent far more than they did in the GFC as a percent of GDP. G20 countries have responded faster than during the GFC: In response to the pandemic, G20 governments announced nearly 8 percent of GDP in fiscal support between early February and early April, with more expected in the coming weeks and months. During the GFC, governmentsâ€™ responses were more protracted: in the United States, the epicenter of the GFC, the Economic Stimulus Act was signed into law in February 2008; the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, which included government funding for the purchase of troubled assets from financial institutions, was signed in October 2008; and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which authorized significant government spending, was signed in February 2009. Thus far, Chinaâ€™s fiscal response is more limited than during the GFC: Chinaâ€™s fiscal support as of April 10 amounts to roughly 1.3 percent of GDP, primarily through loans for impacted businesses and tax relief. This spending at the national level is far lower than the nearly 13 percent of GDP in fiscal spending (inclusive of local, provincial, and national spending) China announced in November 2008 in response to the GFC. Chinese officials have recently signaled they could provide additional stimulus later this year as the health situation stabilizes, but a desire to avoid adding to already high total debt levels will likely limit potential spending. EM economies are more constrained: As a percent of GDP, EM members of the G20 have announced far less fiscal support than AE G20 peers, reflecting, in part, more binding financing constraints. G20 EM fiscal support as of April 10 averages 2 percent of GDP versus 11.7 percent among G20 AEs. Many EMs are at an earlier stage of the pandemic relative to many AEs and may need international support to finance necessary relief measures. Notes: In addition to national efforts detailed above, the European Union has announced several responses: a 37 billion euro (\$40 billion) Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative and a 540 billion euro (\$586 billion) aid package to support member states. Both are not included in the \$6.3 trillion G20 total. Of the \$6.3 trillion of fiscal relief announced by G20 countries as of April 29, about \$45 billion was not itemized as credit enhancement, government spending, or tax relief. This analysis focuses on major, national, discretionary responses in G20 countries and thus does not reflect the full extent of support deployed by these countries in response to Covid-19, such as monetary and regulatory tools (rate cuts, repurchase operations, quantitative easing), automatic spending mechanisms, and additional support from subnational government. We include tax cuts and cancellations in tax relief but do not assign a monetary value to tax deferrals, where possible.

  abstract = {The main argument of this paper is that progress towards gender equality and women's empowerment in the development agenda requires a human rights-based approach, and requires support for the women's movement to activate and energize the agenda. Both are missing from Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 3. Empowerment requires agency along multiple dimensionsâ€”sexual, reproductive, economic, political, and legal. However, MDG 3 frames women's empowerment as reducing educational disparities. By omitting other rights and not recognizing the multiple interdependent and indivisible human rights of women, the goal of empowerment is distorted and â€œdevelopment silosâ€ are created. Women's organizations are key actors in pushing past such distortions and silos at all levels, and hence crucial to pushing the gender equality agenda forward. However, the politics of agenda setting also influences funding priorities such that financial support for women's organizations and for substantive women's empowerment projects is limited. To re-focus the post-2015 Development Agenda around human rights, we conclude by outlining an approach of issue-based goals and people-focused targets, which makes substantive space for civil society including women's rights organizations.},

The pledges and contributions to the GCF made by major rich countries are analyzed. The institutional structure and legal status of the GCF are explained. The first batch of funding allocations began in November 2015, timed for the Paris Conference. This chapter analyzes the 93+ projects that received the funding since then. Allocations of the fund are analyzed by geo-political areas as well as the results areas defined by the GCF Board. This chapter takes a close look at the investment criteria which are relied upon in making funding decisions, which include various concepts such as mitigation impact, adaptation impact, paradigm shift, sustainable development, needs of the recipients, country ownership, and efficiency and effectiveness.},

During the 10 year period between 2002 and 2011, as many as 57 countries have zero or only one poverty estimate. This paper refers to such lack of poverty data as â€œdata deprivation,â€ because the poor are often socially marginalized and voiceless, and the collection of objective and quantitative data is crucial in locating them and formulating policy to help them exit extreme deprivation. This paper studies the extent of data deprivation and proposes targets for ending data deprivation by 2030â€”the year by when the international community aims to end extreme poverty. According to the analysis in this paper, this target is ambitious but possible, and achieving it is necessary to be able to declare the end of extreme poverty with confidence.},

In addition, this paper reviews the current Digital Systems, Transmission Networks, Servers and Management Systems. The next Industrial Revolution will be founded on Artificial Intelligence that will entirely replace humans by taking production and management decisions based on the Internet of Things (IoT), the Cloud, BlockChain, Big Data, Virtual Reality and the combination of digital and real infrastructure or city.

  abstract = {This paper advances a new approach to conceptualise, define and systematically measure women's empowerment. A review of literature identified that empowerment is multidimensional, and that women empowered in one dimension are not necessarily empowered in the other. It was also established that women need both resources and a sense of agency to independently achieve their livelihood outcomes. Therefore, it was concluded that both agency and resources are the best indicators of women's level of empowerment. In view of the multidimensional nature of women's empowerment, this study proposed the use of principal component analysis (PCA) on women's level of agency and resources to generate factor scores (i.e., indicators of each woman's level of empowerment) at each dimension of empowerment (i.e., indicated by each PC) as the better approach to quantitatively measure women's empowerment. Data to test this approach was taken from rural women in Msinga Local Municipality of South Africa. Application of PCA, showed the dominant dimensions in which women in the study area were empowered while the PC factor loadings quantitatively measured the level of empowerment along each dimension. It was concluded that women's empowerment is best conceptualised as increases in women's capabilities and hence, application of PCA to the indicators of women's indicators of resources and agency is the most suitable approach to capture their empowerment levels across different dimensions.},

  abstract = {Background. Previous epidemiological studies indicate large cross-national differences in prevalence of depression.Methods. At 15 centres in 14 countries, 25916 primary care patients were screened for common mental disorders. A stratified random sample of 5447 primary care patients completed a baseline diagnostic assessment and 3197 completed a 12-month follow-up assessment. Psychiatric symptoms and diagnoses were assessed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Interviewer-rated disability was assessed using the Social Disability Schedule (SDS).Results. Prevalence of current major depression varied 15-fold across centres. When centres were divided into three groups according to prevalence rates, the symptom pattern or latent structure of depressive illness was generally similar at low-, medium-, and high-prevalence centres. Depression was universally associated with disability, but this association varied significantly (t = 3Â·51, P = 0Â·0005) across centres. At higher-prevalence centres, depression was associated with lower levels of impairment. At 1 year follow-up, higher prevalence centres had both significantly higher rates of depression onset (t = 3Â·11, P = 0Â·002) and higher rates of persistence among those depressed at baseline (t = 2Â·49, P = 0Â·013).Conclusions. Large cross-national variations in depression prevalence cannot be attributed to â€˜category fallacyâ€™ (cross-national differences in the nature or validity of depressive disorder). Use of identical measures and diagnostic criteria may actually identify different levels of depression severity in different countries or cultures. Cross-national differences in the onset and outcome of depression may reflect either true prevalence differences or differences in diagnostic threshold.},

Taking development policy-making as an illustration, the article suggests that numbers in policy are increasingly imbued with a reasoning according to which it is only necessary to find â€œenoughâ€ correlation. By looking at â€œgood enough data/methods/governanceâ€ in the World Bank and OECD in the context of the â€œfragile statesâ€ agenda, the aim is to show how imperfect methods and objects become authoritative while their imperfection is anything but hidden. As the pursuit of better numbers moves the wheel, the article suggests the need to learn more about authority and power in these dynamics by looking at how errors are a practical, accepted, and ubiquitous element in donorsâ€™ practices.},

As such, it is appropriate to consider deliberative avenues whereby public views could be considered by the G20 in a systematic way to foster forms of accountability. This consideration is animated by deliberative democracy theory and republican theory which advance a normative agenda which seeks to transform governance structures by enhancing the role of deliberation and public reasoning in political life. The article outlines the development of the â€˜Gâ€™ systemâ€™s legitimacy, considers possible modes of accountability and public involvement with respect to the G20 and examines the implications of more formalised public deliberation with respect to the G20.},

Critical voices such as the International Council for Science (ICSU), however, have expressed concerns about the potential incompatibility of the SDGs, specifically the incompatibility of socio-economic development and environmental sustainability. In this paper, we test, quantify and model the alleged inconsistency of SDGs. Our analyses show which SDGs are consistent and which are conflicting. We measure the extent of inconsistency and conclude that the SDG agenda will fail as a whole if we continue with business as usual. We further explore the nature of the inconsistencies using dynamical systems models, which reveal that the focus on economic growth and consumption as a means for development underlies the inconsistency. Our models also show that there are factors which can contribute to development (health programmes, government investment) on the one hand and ecological sustainability (renewable energy) on the other, without triggering the conflict between incompatible SDGs.},

These 17 goals and 169 targets set out an agenda for sustainable development for all nations that embraces economic growth, social inclusion, and environmental protection. Now, the agenda moves from agreeing the goals to implementing and ultimately achieving them. Across the goals, 42 targets focus on means of implementation, and the final goal, Goal 17, is entirely devoted to means of implementation. However, these implementation targets are largely silent about interlinkages and interdependencies among goals. This leaves open the possibility of perverse outcomes and unrealised synergies. We demonstrate that there must be greater attention on interlinkages in three areas: across sectors (e.g., finance, agriculture, energy, and transport), across societal actors (local authorities, government agencies, private sector, and civil society), and between and among low, medium and high income countries. Drawing on a global sustainability science and practice perspective, we provide seven recommendations to improve these interlinkages at both global and national levels, in relation to the UNâ€™s categories of means of implementation: finance, technology, capacity building, trade, policy coherence, partnerships, and, finally, data, monitoring and accountability.},

  abstract = {In this paper we critically examine the concept of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC). It proposes that there is an inverted U-shape relation between environmental degradation and income per capita, so that, eventually, growth reduces the environmental impact of economic activity. The concept is dependent on a model of the economy in which there is no feedback from the quality of the environment to production possibilities, and in which trade has a neutral effect on environmental degradation. The actual violation of these assumptions gives rise to fundamental problems in estimating the parameters of an EKC. The paper identifies other econometric problems with estimates of the EKC, and reviews a number of empirical studies. The inference from some such EKC estimates that further development will reduce environmental degradation is dependent on the assumption that world per capita income is normally distributed when in fact median income is far below mean income. We carry out simulations combining EKC estimates from the literature with World Bank forecasts for economic growth for individual countries, aggregating over countries to derive the global impact. Within the horizon of the Bank's forecast (2025) global emissions of SO2 continue to increase. Forest loss stabilizes before the end of the period but tropical deforestation continues at a constant rate throughout the period.},

Such pressure comes from major donors and from international non-governmental organisations (NGOs) obliged to have an external assessment but who then maintain a high degree of confidentiality and control. That such experiences are widespread reflects the deeply political nature of the field of â€˜global healthâ€™ and the interconnections between priority setting, policy making and project implementation, which sit within a broader set of deeply entrenched power structures.2 3 Researchers in this field routinely find themselves working withinâ€”and studyingâ€”complex power relations and so experience challenges in negotiating their own position between interests of commissioning agencies and funders, implementers and country governments, as well as those of their own research institutions and their partnerships with other researchers spanning high-income, middle-income and low-income countries.4â€“7 They often receive research funding from major donor agencies like the UK Department of International Development (DFID), the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the Agence FranÃ§aise de DÃ©veloppement (AFD), UNITAID and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,8 who commission evaluations for their own funded projects, even though they have â€¦},

All rights reserved.1. IntroductionThe ongoing global pandemic has been both a health crisis andeconomic calamity. The United States Federal Reserve swiftly back-stopped the dollar system with 14 swap agreements and a repofacility. But these efforts were not extended to all but a handfulof Emerging Market and Developing Economies (EMDEs). As aresult, investors fled to this new safety for the dollar and thelargest-ever capital outflows from EMDEs were recorded, leavingmost struggling to defend their currencies, support economicactivity, and invest in necessary health and social infrastructures.Both the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the UnitedNations Conference on Trade and Development estimate thatEMDEs require \$2.5tn to meet immediate financing needs (IMF,2020o; UNCTAD, 2020).Where can countries turn to receive such support? This is thetask of the global financial safety net, a web of â€˜financial resourcesand institutional arrangements that provide a backstop during afinancial or economic crisisâ€™ (Hawkins et al., 2014, p. 2). Notably,this includes central banksâ€™ bilateral swap lines and countriesâ€™ for-eign reserves. The former is only available to a handful of countries.The latter have been dwindling since the onset of the pandemicwith attempts by governments to defend their currencies in lightof capital outflows. Consequently, countries increasingly have nochoice but to seek financial support from the third global financialsafety net pillar: multilateral financial institutions. These encom-pass the IMF and regional financial arrangements (RFAs), like theChiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization or Latin American ReserveFund (Kring \& Gallagher, 2019).This article has two objectives. First, we examine recent policypromises on expanding the global financial safety net and comparethese to pre-pandemic available resources. Second, we presentdata that offer an initial look into what the IMF and RFAs have beendoing: which countries have benefited, what level of financing hasbeen approved, and under what terms? To meet these objectives,we rely on official pronouncements of these institutions and onnewly-developed datasets of lending activities.

  abstract = {Background: The current measuring metric and reporting methods for assessing maternal mortality are seriously flawed. Evidence-based prevention strategies require consistently reported surveillance data and validated measurement metrics., Main Body: The denominator of live births used in the maternal mortality ratio reinforces the mistaken notion that all maternal deaths are consequent to a live birth and, at the same time, inappropriately inflates the value of the ratio for subpopulations of women with the highest percentage of pregnancies ending in outcomes other than a live birth. Inadequate methods for identifying induced or spontaneous abortion complications assure that most maternal deaths associated with those pregnancy outcomes are unlikely to be attributed. Absent the ability to identify all maternal deaths, and without the ability to differentiate those deaths by specific pregnancy outcomes, existing variations in pregnancy outcome-specific maternal deaths are masked by the use of an aggregated (all outcome) numerator. Under these circumstances, clear and accurate data is not available to inform evidence-based preventive strategies. As the result, algorithms applied for analyzing maternal mortality data may return distorted results, Conclusion: Improvement in the effectiveness of maternal mortality surveillance will require: mandatory certification of all fetal losses; linkage of death, birth and all fetal loss (induced and natural) certificates; modification of the structure of the overall maternal mortality ratio to enable pregnancy outcome-specific ratio calculations; development of the appropriate ICD codes which are specific to induced and spontaneous abortions; education for providers on identifying and reporting early pregnancy losses; and, flexible information systems and methods which integrate these capabilities and inform users.},

Disparaging analysis suggests that there exists a potential inconsistency in the SDGs, particularly between the socio-economic development and the environmental sustainability goals. Critiques also raise questions on the measurability and monitoring of the broadly framed SDGs. The goals are non-binding, with each country being expected to create their own national or regional plans. Moreover, the source(s) and the extent of the financial resources and investments for the SDGs are ambiguous. This chapter quantifies and examines the inconsistencies of the SDGs. It further inspects which of the underlying social, economic or environmental pillars are that most effective for achieving sustainable development. Analyses of the data reveal that the developed countries need to remain focused on their social and environmental policies. The developing countries, on the other hand, are better off being focused on their economics and social policies in the short run, even though environmental policies remain significant for sustainable development.},

The motivation behind the study stems from the renewed interest in inequality in academia, public discourse, and in global policy. First, we argue that inequality should be considered when constructing development indicators. The role of distribution in development is important both because people generally prefer lower inequality and inequality tends to have negative effects on development outcomes. Second, we analyze how ten selected development indicators account for inequality (in terms of justification, type of inequality, measure of inequality, and method of incorporation) and what the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches are. We found considerable diversity especially for inequality measures and methods of incorporation. As for the type of inequality, inequality of opportunities is considered marginally and overlapping inequalities not at all; increasing data availability opens the door for inclusion especially for the latter aspect. As most indicators suffer from insufficient methodological substantiation, we argue for increased clarity regarding why and how inequality is accounted for in development indicators. The analysis is complemented by a detailed review of treatment of inequality by the analyzed indicators (Annex).},

This composite measure, which we call the Patriarchy Index, combines a range of variables related to familial behavior that reflect varying degrees of sex- and age-related social inequality across different family settings. We demonstrate the comparative advantages of the index by showing how 266 historical populations from the Atlantic coast of Europe to Moscow scored on the patriarchy scale. We then compare the index with contemporary measures of gender discrimination, and find a strong correlation between historical and current inequality patterns. Finally, we explore how variation in patriarchy levels across Europe is related to the socioeconomic and institutional characteristics of the regional populations, and to variation across these regions in their degree of demographic centrality and environmental conditions. The results confirm previous findings that family organization is a crucial generator of social inequality, and point to the importance of considering the historical context when analyzing the current global contours of inequality.},

  abstract = {BSTRACT Discussions on the politics of Chinese engagement with African development have been marked by increasing concern over Chinese use of aid in exchange for preferential energy deals. Normative liberal discourse criticizes the Chinese for disbursing 'rogue aid' and undermining good governance in the African continent. These criticisms not only ignore the longer-term motivations and modalities of Chinese aid and the historical diversity of Chinese relations with Africa, but also uncritically assume 'Western' aid to be morally 'superior' and 'more effective' in terms of development outcomes. This paper consists of three parts. First, it will discuss the debates surrounding Chinese engagement in Africa, especially around aid and development issues. Second, the paper maps the historical development of China-Africa engagement and investigates the impacts of the changing modalities of Chinese aid with reference to case studies of two countries: Angola and Ghana. It then offers a comparative analysis of the similarities and differences between these two cases. The principal argument is that Chinese and Western donors employ different ideologies and practices of governance to conceal their own interests and political discourses in the African continent.},

  abstract = {Human capital is identified as one of the main determinants of economic growth and plays an important role in the technological progress of countries. Nevertheless, existing studies have to some extent neglected the importance of human capital in the growth process via the interaction it can have with a countryâ€™s industrial specialization. Additionally, the emphasis is mainly placed on supply-side determinants, while demand-side factors are neglected, particularly the relevance of the processes of structural change. Thus, using a growth model which integrates variables from both the supply side and demand side, we assess the direct and indirect effects of human capital on economic growth, including in the latter the interaction of human capital with the industrial specialization of countries. Based on dynamic panel data estimations, we found that human capital and the countriesâ€™ productive specialization dynamics are crucial factors for economic growth. Moreover, the interaction between human capital and structural change in high knowledge-intensive industries impacts significantly on economic growth. However, the sign of this effect depends on the type of country and the period of analysis. Specifically, over a longer time span (1960â€“2011) and for more highly developed (OECD) countries, the impact of the interaction between human capital and structural change is positive. When we also include transition and Mediterranean countries over a shorter time period (1990â€“2011), we find that human capital significantly and positively impacts on the countriesâ€™ economic growth but the effect of human capital via specialization in high-tech and knowledge-intensive activities is negative. The latter result indicates that the lack of industrial structures able to properly integrate highly educated individuals into the productive system leads countries to experience disappointing economic returns.},

However, most Latin American countries do not collect race and ethnic data or do so inappropriately and thus there is an urgent need for census and national survey systems to begin collecting such data.

  abstract = {Shancholâ„¢, a WHO-prequalified oral cholera vaccine (OCV), has been used to control endemic cholera in Asia, as well as in emergencies and outbreaks elsewhere. The vaccine has not been used by public health systems in cholera-endemic settings of Africa although several outbreak response campaigns have been conducted. Here we present experiences from a mass vaccination campaign in a cholera-endemic setting of Ethiopia in which Shancholâ„¢ was introduced through the public health system. The vaccination site was selected based on cholera cases reported in previous years. Social mobilization involved sensitization of community leaders, household visits, and mass distribution of banners, posters and leaflets. The vaccination was implemented after careful microplanning of logistics and cold chain, manpower, transportation, vaccine supply and supervision and monitoring of adverse events. Vaccine administration was recorded on individual vaccination cards. Vaccine delivery costs were collected and analyzed after vaccination. As there was no experience with Shancholâ„¢ in Ethiopia, a bridging trial was conducted to demonstrate safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine in the local population prior to the mass vaccination. Oral cholera vaccination was conducted in two rounds of four days each in February 2015 and March 2015 in 10 selected villages of Shashemenae rural district of Ethiopia. A total of 62,161 people targeted. 47,137 people (76\%) received the first dose, and 40,707 (65\%) received two doses. The financial cost of the vaccination campaign was estimated at US \$2Â·60 per dose or US \$5Â·64 per fully immunized person. The cost of vaccine delivery excluding vaccine procurement was \$0Â·68 per dose or \$1Â·48 per fully immunized person. The study demonstrates that mass cholera vaccination administered through the public health system in Ethiopia is feasible, can be implemented through the existing health system at an affordable cost, and the vaccine is acceptable to the community. The lessons from this study are useful for deploying OCV in other African endemic settings through the public health system and may guide future immunization policy decisions.},

Although for the most part these investments are motivated by the desire to increase economic productivity and employment, we find that infrastructure either directly or indirectly influences the attainment of all of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including 72\% of the targets. We categorize the positive and negative effects of infrastructure and the interdependencies between infrastructure sectors. To ensure that the right infrastructure is built, policymakers need to establish long-term visions for sustainable national infrastructure systems, informed by the SDGs, and develop adaptable plans that can demonstrably deliver their vision.},

Model-based FD-HM computational approaches have been extensively developed to detect and locate faults by considering logical or mathematical description of the monitored process. However, because of parametric, measurement and model uncertainties, applicable approaches that endeavor to locate faults with great accuracy are likely to give false alarms. Recently, many research works have been conducted in order to tackle this issue by making a tradeoff between accuracy and robustness during the fault detection phase. Due to the recent advances in sensor technology, computational capabilities and dedicated software/hardware interfaces, data-driven FD-HM approaches have demonstrated that highly accurate fault detection is possible when the system monitoring data for nominal and degraded conditions are available. Therefore, it seems that more than one approach is usually required for developing a complete robust fault detection and diagnosis tool. In this paper, the features of different model-based and data-driven approaches are investigated separately as well as the existing works that attempted to integrate both of them. In this latter context, there have been only few works published in the literature and hence reviewing and discussing them is strongly motivated by providing a good reference for those interested in developing hybrid approaches for FD-HM.},

Rural districts, in which production sectors more exposed to liberalization were concentrated, experienced slower decline in poverty and lower consumption growth. The impact of liberalization was most pronounced among the least geographically mobile at the bottom of the income distribution, and in Indian states where inflexible labor laws impeded factor reallocation across sectors.

The OECD produces data, research and policy recommendations on many issues related to sustainable development, including climate change, co-operation with developing countries and corporate social responsibility. OECD Insights: Sustainable Development draws on that expertise. It argues that to be sustainable, development has to be based on progress in three areas at once: the economy, society and the environment.},

  abstract = {The paper examines the level and changes in female and male participation rates, employment segregation and female relative to male wages across the world economy. It finds sufficient evidence to support the view that labor markets in developing countries are transformed relatively quickly in the sense that gender differentials in employment and pay are narrowing much faster than they did in industrialized countries. The paper evaluates the inefficiencies arising from persisting gender differentials in the labor market and finds them to be potentially significant. The estimates also indicate that the resulting deadweight losses are borne primarily by women while men gain mainly in relative terms â€” there are no real winners from discrimination. The paper concludes that growth benefits women at large, inequalities can have significantly adverse effects on welfare, and market-based development alone can be a weak instrument for reducing inequality between the sexes. To break the vicious circle of women's low initial human capital endowments and inferior labor market outcomes compared to men's, the paper proposes greater access of girls to education and of women to training, enforceable equal pay and equal employment opportunities legislation, a taxation and benefits structure that treats reproduction as an economic activity and women as equal partners within households, and a better accounting of women's work to include invisible production.},

The significant transformation that has occurred in recent decades has given greater understanding and recognition to the role of urbanization in development. However, the issues around housing have not received sufficient attention within the urbanization process. Compounded by rapid population growth and remaining high levels of poverty, cities in the developing world are facing persistent challenges to meet their housing needs. Not only the lack of adequate housing is enormous, but in many countries the stock of vacant houses increases even when millions of people have nowhere to live. Housing affordability has become a global crisis with strong negative impact on the wellbeing of people and on the exacerbation of urban inequality. One of the worst global economic crises of last decades had housing at its epicentre, entrenched in a combination of aggressive financing and ownership models that stressed speculation over social welfare.},

Experts from, Asia, Africa, Arab countries and Latin America agreed that a prosperous city integrates 6 critical dimensions: 1) productivity; 2) infrastructure development; 3) quality of life; 4) equity and social inclusion; 5) environmental sustainability and; 6) governance and legislation. Accordingly, it was unanimously agreed that prosperity implies success, wealth, thriving conditions, well-being as well as confidence in the future and opportunities for all. Further, prosperous cities offer a profusion of public goods, allowing for equitable access to â€˜commonsâ€™ and the development of sustainable policies.},

Owing to their unique character of population and investment agglomeration, cities link the economic, energy, environment, science, technology and social and economic elements of development, all of which constitute the key interrelations needed to formulate integrated policies required to achieve sustainable development.

The implementation of the New Urban Agenda is crucial for the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals as well as the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. How we envisage and share our urban spaces ultimately impacts how we address global challenges, and it is in our cities, towns, and villages where actions must be prioritized and operationalized. Over 30,000 Conference participants came together in Quito to discuss this common vision for sustainable development and its effective implementation.},

The Habitat III Conference and its preparatory process provided a unique opportunity to bring together diverse urban actors, including local authorities and the United Nations system expertise, to contribute to the development of the New Urban Agenda in the new global development context after the historic adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Goals, the Paris Agreement on climate change, and other global development agreements and frameworks. In September 2014, during the first session of the Habitat III Preparatory Committee (PrepCom 1) held in New York at the United Nations headquarters, the Secretary-General of the Conference, Dr. Joan Clos, presented a report1 on the preparations for the Conference and launched an innovative, inclusive, and action-oriented preparatory process carried out in four areas: knowledge, engagement, policy, and operations. The Secretary-General of the Conference also expressed his intention to create the United Nations Task Team on Habitat III as an inter-agency group in which focal points of several United Nations system would coordinate system-wide preparations towards Habitat III. The Habitat III Strategic Framework was developed based on these aforementioned four areas, while linkages among the four areas were guided by the principles of innovation and inclusiveness requested by Member States. The Habitat III Issue Papers were identified as one of the first outcomes in the knowledge area of the Strategic Framework, and the United Nations Task Team on Habitat III was invited to develop them.},

  abstract = {The city is the home of prosperity. It is the place where human beings find satisfaction of basic needs and access to essential public goods. The city is also where ambitions, aspirations and other material and immaterial aspects of life are realized, providing contentment and happiness. It is a locus at which the prospects of prosperity and individual and collective well-being can be increased. What this new edition of State of the world's cities shows is that prosperity for all has been compromised by a narrow focus on economic growth. UN-Habitat suggests a fresh approach to prosperity beyond the solely economic emphasis, including other vital dimensions such as quality of life, adequate infrastructures, equity and environmental sustainability. The Report proposes a new tool - the City Prosperity Index - together with a conceptual matrix, the Wheel of Prosperity, both of which are meant to assist decision makers to design clear policy interventions. The Report advocates for the need of cities to enhance the public realm, expand public goods and consolidate rights to the 'commons' for all as a way to expand prosperity. This comes in response to the observed trend of enclosing or restricting these goods and commons in enclaves of prosperity, or depleting them through unsustainable use. - Publisher.},

With nearly one billion people having little or no schooling and women and girls comprising nearly two-thirds of this total, this book analyses the historical, sociological, political and philosophical issues involved as well as exploring actions taken by governments, Inter-Government Organisations, NGOs and women's groups since 1990 to combat this injustice. Written by a recognised expert in this field, the book is organised clearly into three parts:   the first provides a background to the history of the provision of schooling for girls worldwide since 1945 and locates the challenges of gender inequality in education  the second examines different views as to why questions of gender and schooling should be addressed globally, contrasting arguments based on human capital theory, rights and capabilities the third analyses how governments, Inter-Government Organisations and NGOs have put policy into practice.   Addressing the urgent global challenges in gender and schooling, this book calls for a new connected approach in policy and practice. It is essential reading for all those interested in education, along with developmental studies, sociology, politics and women's studies.},

Three dilemmas relating to whether one prioritises what works or what matters in poverty reduction are considered. The first dilemma is entailed in translating between different contexts of public policy formation, professional work, and lived experience in relation to gender and poverty. Is â€˜what worksâ€™ achieved at the expense of â€˜what mattersâ€™? The second arises from a problem of attempting to build transversal dialogues across differently situated actors and the extent to which building a process of understanding of â€˜what mattersâ€™ is enough to go beyond advocacy to selecting the appropriate action. The last is the dilemma of prioritisation. Is it more important to address poverty and gender sequentially or in tandem? Taking examples drawn from a research project on the interpretation of the gender Millennium Development Goal (MDG3) in Kenya and South Africa, and drawing on some of the conceptual resources associated with Amartya Sen's comparative approach to justice, the analysis attempts to address some of the challenges of the relationship of what works, what matters and the complexity of intersecting injustices.},

However, from a human development perspective, the narrow framing of the education targets and indicators in the MDGs had perverse consequences, stemming from the omission of salient aspects of quality, context, and equity. The selected targets limited the capacity of the education sector to support other MDGs. In thinking about indicators for a post-2015 framework, this paper considers the history of how and why the indicators for MDG 2 were selected and puts forward some critical reflections on two alternative indicators for the education goal in a post-2015 framework.},

Yet despite concerted efforts from national governments, multilateral organisations and NGOs over many decades we are still far from achieving education for all. In addition, while education can enhance human development, it is also associated with persistent inequalities. Education and International Development provides a comprehensive introduction to the field, giving an overview of the history, influential theories, important concepts and areas of achievement, and presenting a critical reflection on emerging trends in policy, practice and research. With chapters that review key challenges and inspiring initiatives in countries around the globe - focusing on critical issues such as language, conflict and teachers - this book serves both as a companion to graduate studies in international education and a concise reference book for practitioners and educators in the field.},

  abstract = {The formulation of the SDG education targets was more inclusive than the processes linked with the MDGs. Key constituencies making representations through the Open Working Group and other consultative processes succeeded in formulating targets that stressed inclusion, quality and equality in all phases of education. However, the development of the global indicators for SDG4, has resulted in metrics that miss many of the values of the targets, most notably with regard to quality and free education and substantive, not simply distributive, meanings of equality. The article analyses why some of these slippages took place, and what potential there may be to mobilise for metrics that better depict the key tenets of the education goal and targets. The analysis thus considers ways forward for exploring measurement of the many meanings of quality and equalities in education, reflecting on numbers as instruments that impose power and hierarchy, and the possibility of using reflections on numbers and indicators for critical dialogue and an enhancement of participation, accountability, and work to change injustices in education.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTIONDevelopment indicators constitute a technology of global governance because of their knowledge and their governance effects. The knowledge effect is determined by the underlying development theory that is promoted by both indicator users and generators, which may be articulated through an economic, an institutional, or a rights-based frame of reference. The increased use of expert knowledge in the development field has encouraged the use of indicators as a proxy for development not only by hegemonic institutions, such as the World Bank, but also by other indicator users or generators that seek to contest the development â€œcommonsense.â€ The World Bank remains one of the most important producers and users of indicators, and through its World Development Indicators (WDI) it has managed to promote hegemonic theories of development based on economics-based frames of reference. Although the World Bank has expanded its development discourse to include concerns of institutions and rights-based approaches, it has continuously relied on economic indicators as the main tool to measure development.Once the knowledge that is being promoted by the development indicator is established, it becomes easier to unveil the production of standards and identities that are being shaped in the development field as a result of the use of a specific indicator. The development knowledge disseminated by the indicator in turn shapes the outcome of its governance effect. As described in the third section, indicators can have a wide range of effects on global governance; however, the most common ones for the development field are the regulatory effect and the allocation of responsibilities. The regulatory effect should be understood as a type of governance at a distance, as â€œindicator usersâ€ can influence the performance of â€œindicator targetsâ€ by sending signals of the kind of society that is expected from developed societies, This effect increases when performance indicators are used to allocate aid based on the economic incentive.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTIONThis chapter explores some of the ways in which indicators interact with law. Accordingly, it studies the Rule of Law Index, an indicator developed and applied by the World Justice Project to measure the adherence of almost 200 countries to the rule of law. Such quantitative technologies of measurement, this chapter argues, are here to stay in the law and development agenda. They create a community of practice and provide normative criteria for the evaluation of whether a country adheres to their particular idea of what the rule of law is (and is not). Because of their origin in multilateral financial institutions, the Index and other rule of law indicators tend to be seen by some as implausible neoliberal simplifications that simply should be dismissed. This chapter takes a different perspective. Irrespective of the Index's origins, the genie is out of the bottle. Rule of law indicators are veritable technologies of global governance, and it is therefore important to engage with them, as they open a space for contestation, intervention, and policy debate on what it means to encourage the rule of law in the developing world.The chapter is organized in three parts. The first one puts the Index in context and argues that it can be read as an expression of a post-neoliberal moment of the law and development agenda. The second part unpacks the Index itselfâ€“ its added-value and methodologyâ€“ and proposes a characterization of the notion of rule of law that underlies it. According to this section, the â€œrule of lawâ€ of the Index is substantive, non instrumental, and features a certain realist sensibility. Building on these premises, in the third part I rethink the role that the Index, and other rule of law indicators like it, play in global governance. The fourth part concludes the chapter.},

  abstract = {Previous studies have demonstrated that N,N-diethyldithiocarbamate (DEDC) elevates copper and promotes oxidative stress within the nervous system. However, whether these effects resolve following cessation of exposure or have the potential to persist and result in cumulative injury has not been determined. In this study, an established model for DEDC myelin injury in the rat was used to determine whether copper levels, oxidative stress, and neuromuscular deficits resolve following the cessation of DEDC exposure. Rats were exposed to DEDC for 8 weeks and then either euthanized or maintained for 2, 6 or 12 weeks after cessation of exposure. At each time point copper levels were measured by inductively coupled mass spectrometry to assess the ability of sciatic nerve, brain, spinal cord and liver to eliminate excess copper post-exposure. The protein expression levels of glutathione transferase alpha, heme oxygenase 1 and superoxide dismutase 1 in peripheral nerve and brain were also determined by western blot to assess levels of oxidative stress as a function of post-exposure duration. As an initial assessment of the bioavailability of the excess copper in brain the protein expression levels of copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase 1, and prion protein were determined by western blot as a function of exposure and post-exposure duration. Neuromuscular function in peripheral nerve was evaluated using grip strengths, nerve conduction velocities, and morphologic changes at the light microscope level. The data demonstrated that in peripheral nerve, copper levels and oxidative stress return to control levels within several weeks after cessation of exposure. Neuromuscular function also showed a trend towards pre-exposure values, although the resolution of myelin lesions was more delayed. In contrast, total copper and antioxidant enzyme levels remained significantly elevated in brain for longer post-exposure periods. The persistence of effects observed in brain suggests that the central nervous system is more susceptible to long-term cumulative adverse effects from dithiocarbamates. Additionally, significant changes in expression levels of chaperone for superoxide dismutase 1, and prion protein were observed consistent with at least a portion of the excess copper being bioactive.},

These include the process of working through consensus to assess and summarize climate science and the need to include knowledge from as many of the 195 IPCC nation-states as possible, despite the structural inequalities between developed and developing countries. To highlight salient features that are unique to the IPCC but that offer lessons for other organizations that conduct GEAs, we include case studies on the politics of climate denialism, the use of geoengineering in mitigation scenarios, and the links between adaptive capacity, adaptation, and global development. We conclude with a discussion of institutional reflexivity. We consider how the IPCC can model an ethical and participatory response to climate change by critically examining, and being transparent about, the relation between science and politics.},

  abstract = {China's increasing role as a provider of overseas aid is the subject of considerable debate both within and outside of China. However, despite research activity examining how Chinese aid is materialized, very little is actually known about why Chinese aid projects are developed or implemented the way they are. Although recent indications suggest the Chinese government is increasingly willing to be more open about overseas aid, for example, the release of the first White Paper on Foreign Aid in 2011, external observers remain largely unaware of the values, goals and motivations behind Chinese aid projects. Alongside this lack of information, non-Chinese analyses tend to be founded on a Realist approach to understanding international relations in which a "rising power" such as China automatically constitutes a threat to existing power relations. As a result, many scholars conclude that China's aid is part of a strategic quest to further its own geopolitical ends. This paper provides insights into the contentious topic of the drivers behind Chinese overseas development assistance. It finds that Chinese elites in the international development sphere do not share the views prevalent in Western international relations discourse about the international system and China's role within it.This article argues that exploring Chinese development actors' and commentators' conceptions of what development means, along with their views on China's role and obligations within the international system, allows a better understanding of the motivations behind Chinese aid, and a reexamination of some of the misconceptions around Chinese aid as a tool of Chinese geopolitical strategy.},

  abstract = {Background: Maternal near-miss (MNM) is an important maternal health quality-of-care indicator. To facilitate comparison between countries, the World Health Organization (WHO) developed the "MNM-tool". However, several low- and middle-income countries have proposed adaptations to prevent underreporting, ie, Namibian and Sub-Sahara African (SSA)-criteria. This study aims to assess MNM and associated factors in middle-income country Suriname by applying the three different MNM tools. Methods: A nationwide prospective population-based cohort study was conducted using the Suriname Obstetric Surveillance System (SurOSS). We included women with MNM-criteria defined by WHO-, Namibian- and SSA-tools during one year (March 2017-February 2018) and used hospital births (86\% of total) as a reference group. Results: There were 9114 hospital live births in Suriname in the one-year study period. SurOSS identified 71 women with WHO-MNM (8/1000 live births, mortality-index 12\%), 118 with Namibian-MNM (13/1000 live births, mortality-index 8\%), and 242 with SSA-MNM (27/1000 live births, mortality-index 4\%). Namibian- and SSA-tools identified all women with WHO-criteria. Blood transfusion thresholds and eclampsia explained the majority of differences in MNM prevalence. Eclampsia was not considered a WHO-MNM in 80\% (n\,=\,35/44) of cases. Nevertheless, mortality-index for MNM with hypertensive disorders was 17\% and the most frequent underlying cause of maternal deaths (n\,=\,4/10, 40\%) and MNM (n\,=\,24/71, 34\%). Women of advanced age and maroon ethnicity had twice the odds of WHO-MNM (respectively adjusted odds ratio (aOR)\,=\,2.6, 95\% confidence interval (CI)\,=\,1.4-4.8 and aOR\,=\,2.0, 95\% CI\,=\,1.2-3.6). The stillbirths rate among women with WHO-MNM was 193/1000births, with six times higher odds than women without MNM (aOR\,=\,6.8, 95\%CI\,=\,3.0-15.8). While the prevalence and mortality-index differ between the three MNM tools, the underlying causes of and factors associated with MNM were comparable. Conclusions: The MNM ratio in Suriname is comparable to other countries in the region. The WHO-tool underestimates the prevalence of MNM (high mortality-index), while the adapted tools may overestimate MNM and compromise global comparability. Contextualized MNM-criteria per obstetric transition stage may improve comparability and reduce underreporting. While MNM studies facilitate international comparison, audit will remain necessary to identify shortfalls in quality-of-care and improve maternal outcomes.},

We calculated neonatal (age 0â€“27 days), post-neonatal (age 28â€“364 days), child (age 1â€“4 years), and under-5 mortality rates (U5MRs) for each ethnic group within each country. We assessed differences in mortality between ethnic groups using a likelihood ratio test, Theil's index, and between-group variance. We used multivariable analyses of U5MR by ethnicity to adjust for household wealth, maternal education, and urbanâ€“rural residence.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Findings{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}We included data from 36 LMICs, which included 2 812 381 livebirths among 415 ethnic groups. In 25 countries, significant differences in U5MR by ethnic group were identified (all p{$<$}0Â·05 likelihood ratio test). In these countries, the median mortality ratio between the ethnic groups with the highest and lowest U5MRs was 3Â·3 (IQR 2Â·1â€“5Â·2; range 1Â·5â€“8Â·5), whereas among the remaining 11 countries, the median U5MR ratio was 1Â·9 (IQR 1Â·7â€“2Â·5; range 1Â·4â€“10Â·0). Ethnic gaps were wider for child mortality than for neonatal or post-neonatal mortality. In nearly all countries, adjustment for wealth, education, and place of residence did not affect ethnic gaps in mortality, with the exception of Guatemala, India, Laos, and Nigeria. The largest ethnic group did not have the lowest U5MR in any of the countries studied.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Interpretation{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Significant ethnic disparities in child survival were identified in more than two-thirds of the countries studied.

Using published data, we estimate the disease burden for mental illness to show that the global burden of mental illness accounts for 32Â·4\% of years lived with disability (YLDs) and 13Â·0\% of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), instead of the earlier estimates suggesting 21Â·2\% of YLDs and 7Â·1\% of DALYs. Currently used approaches underestimate the burden of mental illness by more than a third. Our estimates place mental illness a distant first in global burden of disease in terms of YLDs, and level with cardiovascular and circulatory diseases in terms of DALYs. The unacceptable apathy of governments and funders of global health must be overcome to mitigate the human, social, and economic costs of mental illness.},

The long-term character of climate change and the high costs of adaptation measures, in combination with their uncertain effects, turn climate adaptation governance into a torturous process. We systematically review the literature on climate adaptation governance to analyze the scholarly understanding of these complexities. Building on governance literature about long-term and complex policy problems, we develop a conceptual matrix based on the dimensions knowledge and power to systematically study the peer-reviewed literature on climate adaptation governance. We find that about a quarter of the reviewed journal articles do not address the knowledge or power dimension of the governance of climate change adaptation, about half of the articles discuss either the knowledge or the power dimension, and another quarter discuss both knowledge and power. The articles that do address both knowledge and power (1) conceptualize the governance of climate adaptation mainly as a complex system of regulatory frameworks and technical knowledge, (2) assume that regulatory systems can be easily adapted to new knowledge, (3) pay little attention to fluid or unorganized forms of power, e.g., negotiation, and knowledge, e.g., learning, and (4) largely neglect the interplay between the two. We argue that more research on this interplay is needed, and we discuss how puzzling and powering are a promising pair of concepts to study this.},

However, the potential for socioeconomic representation to benefit those from a lower socioeconomic background has not been thoroughly explored. Using the Early Childhood Longitudinal Studyâ€”Kindergarten Cohort 2011 and a student fixed-effects approach, I begin to fill this gap in the literature by investigating whether socioeconomic representationâ€”above and beyond and intersecting with racial and ethnic representationâ€”affects teachers' perceptions of their relationships with students. Heterogeneity by an organizational context likely to affect the saliency of SES is also explored. Overall results show no evidence that SES match between teachers and students influences teachers' rating of relationship quality with students. For low-SES black students, racial representation persists as an important factor in better teacherâ€“student relationships, even controlling for socioeconomic representation. However, for low-SES white students in contexts where SES is likely to be particularly salient, socioeconomic representation has a significant positive effect on teacherâ€“student relationship quality. Results exploring the interaction of racial and socioeconomic representation are also presented. Finally, theoretical and practical implications, as well as directions for future research, are discussed.},

  abstract = {The study of transparency is increasingly a more topical, broadly relevant, but also more under-researched enterprise. The Asian financial crisis has highlighted not only the welfare consequences of financial sector transparency, sparking a series of yet unresolved debates, but has also linked this relatively narrow problem to the broader context of transparency in governance. Its significance has broadened geographically as well as across different sectors. It has been observed that curtailment of transparency, often on scanty pretexts, is commonplace even in the highly developed countries. This suggests a broad and possibly radical reform agenda. Departing from the urgency of these observations, this paper reviews the existing literature on transparency in finance and governance, indicates remaining knowledge gaps, and offers some hypothesis on the mutual significance of the two issues. The first two sections of the paper outlines a conceptual framework for defining and measuring transparency that distinguishes among its desirable characteristics; access, timeliness, relevance, and quality. It also suggests methodologies that may produce tractable measures of transparency. Additionally, it places in context debates concerning transparency; its desirability, contingency, complexity and regulation. Reviewing critiques of objections against disclosure, the chapter advances a general preference for transparency, not only in the developing but also in the developed world. Nevertheless, it emphasizes the need to weigh the costs and benefits of more transparency in designing regulatory policy. In general, while consequences of information imperfections are well recognized, the solution is not simply a matter of more information. The third section treats the role of transparency in promoting greater financial stability, acknowledging exceptions to the general preference expressed earlier, in relation to financial stability. It treats as priority policy issues the following problems: developing institutional infrastructure, developing standards and accounting practices, improving incentives for disclosure and balancing countervailing regulations to minimize perverse incentives generated by safety net arrangements such as deposit insurance. An important suggestion is that since institutional development is gradual, relatively simple regulations such as limits on credit expansion, may be best tailored to developing countries. Implicit in this section is the notion that there are absolute limits to transparency, in particular for lack of adequate enforcement. The last section elaborates on the concomitant link between financial markets and governance, discussing select consequences of transparency for national-level and local governance, identifying some policy implications and suggesting further research issues. As illustrated by the case of Indonesia, it argues that financial reform may be predicated on broader public sector reforms. Again, because formal institutions take time to develop, it highlights three principles of reform to promote incentives for openness: harnessing private sector participation in service provision, promoting exit and contestability, and encouraging "voice" and public participation. These are now increasingly being integrated to new innovative data collection and analysis techniques, and to particular dissemination methods promoting collective action to improve governance and enhance transparency. The chapter concludes by outlining the difficulties of implementing greater participation and voice.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h2{$>$}Summary{$<$}/h2{$><$}h3{$>$}Background{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}In an era of shifting global agendas and expanded emphasis on non-communicable diseases and injuries along with communicable diseases, sound evidence on trends by cause at the national level is essential. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) provides a systematic scientific assessment of published, publicly available, and contributed data on incidence, prevalence, and mortality for a mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive list of diseases and injuries.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Methods{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}GBD estimates incidence, prevalence, mortality, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) due to 369 diseases and injuries, for two sexes, and for 204 countries and territories. Input data were extracted from censuses, household surveys, civil registration and vital statistics, disease registries, health service use, air pollution monitors, satellite imaging, disease notifications, and other sources. Cause-specific death rates and cause fractions were calculated using the Cause of Death Ensemble model and spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression. Cause-specific deaths were adjusted to match the total all-cause deaths calculated as part of the GBD population, fertility, and mortality estimates. Deaths were multiplied by standard life expectancy at each age to calculate YLLs. A Bayesian meta-regression modelling tool, DisMod-MR 2.1, was used to ensure consistency between incidence, prevalence, remission, excess mortality, and cause-specific mortality for most causes. Prevalence estimates were multiplied by disability weights for mutually exclusive sequelae of diseases and injuries to calculate YLDs. We considered results in the context of the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a composite indicator of income per capita, years of schooling, and fertility rate in females younger than 25 years. Uncertainty intervals (UIs) were generated for every metric using the 25th and 975th ordered 1000 draw values of the posterior distribution.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Findings{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Global health has steadily improved over the past 30 years as measured by age-standardised DALY rates. After taking into account population growth and ageing, the absolute number of DALYs has remained stable. Since 2010, the pace of decline in global age-standardised DALY rates has accelerated in age groups younger than 50 years compared with the 1990â€“2010 time period, with the greatest annualised rate of decline occurring in the 0â€“9-year age group. Six infectious diseases were among the top ten causes of DALYs in children younger than 10 years in 2019: lower respiratory infections (ranked second), diarrhoeal diseases (third), malaria (fifth), meningitis (sixth), whooping cough (ninth), and sexually transmitted infections (which, in this age group, is fully accounted for by congenital syphilis; ranked tenth). In adolescents aged 10â€“24 years, three injury causes were among the top causes of DALYs: road injuries (ranked first), self-harm (third), and interpersonal violence (fifth). Five of the causes that were in the top ten for ages 10â€“24 years were also in the top ten in the 25â€“49-year age group: road injuries (ranked first), HIV/AIDS (second), low back pain (fourth), headache disorders (fifth), and depressive disorders (sixth). In 2019, ischaemic heart disease and stroke were the top-ranked causes of DALYs in both the 50â€“74-year and 75-years-and-older age groups. Since 1990, there has been a marked shift towards a greater proportion of burden due to YLDs from non-communicable diseases and injuries. In 2019, there were 11 countries where non-communicable disease and injury YLDs constituted more than half of all disease burden. Decreases in age-standardised DALY rates have accelerated over the past decade in countries at the lower end of the SDI range, while improvements have started to stagnate or even reverse in countries with higher SDI.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Interpretation{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}As disability becomes an increasingly large component of disease burden and a larger component of health expenditure, greater research and development investment is needed to identify new, more effective intervention strategies. With a rapidly ageing global population, the demands on health services to deal with disabling outcomes, which increase with age, will require policy makers to anticipate these changes. The mix of universal and more geographically specific influences on health reinforces the need for regular reporting on population health in detail and by underlying cause to help decision makers to identify success stories of disease control to emulate, as well as opportunities to improve.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Funding{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Bill \& Melinda Gates Foundation.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

New evidence on the time paths of economic growth, physical capital investment, and openness around episodes of trade policy liberalization is also presented. Analysis based on the new data set suggests that over the 1950â€“98 period, countries that liberalized their trade regimes experienced average annual growth rates that were about 1.5 percentage points higher than before liberalization. Postliberalization investment rates rose 1.5â€“2.0 percentage points, confirming past findings that liberalization fosters growth in part through its effect on physical capital accumulation. Liberalization raised the average trade to GDP ratio by roughly 5 percentage points, suggesting that trade policy liberalization did indeed raise the actual level of openness of liberalizers. However, these average effects mask large differences across countries.},

  abstract = {Many developing and transitional countries have grown faster than advanced countries in the past decade, resulting in a shift in the distribution of world income in their favor. China is now the second largest economy in the world, behind the United States and ahead of Japan. As the relative economic weight of China and several others has come to match or exceed that of the middle-ranking G7 economies, the world economy has shifted from ?unipolar? toward ?multipolar,? less dominated by the G7. How is this change being translated into changes in authority and influence within multilateral organizations like the G20, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)? Alarm bells are ringing in G7 capitals about G7 loss of influence. According to a WikiLeaks cable from the senior U.S. official for the G20 process, from January 2010, ?It is remarkable how closely coordinated the BASIC group of countries [Brazil, South Africa, India, China] have become in international fora, taking turns to impede US/EU initiatives and playing the US and EU off against each other.?This essay suggests that the shift in power is much smaller than the headlines or private alarm bells suggest. The United States remains the dominant state, and the G7 states together continue to exercise primacy, but now more fearfully and defensively. China is split between asserting itself as ?the wave of the future? and defending itself as too poor to take on global responsibilities (it is roughly 100th in the per capita income hierarchy). The combination of G7 defensiveness and emerging states? jealous guarding of sovereignty produces a spirit of Westphalian assertion in international fora, or ?every state for itself.? On the assumption that the world economy is in a transitional period, the article suggests reforms in the G20 and the World Bank that would boost their role and legitimacy as multilateral organizations in a more multipolar world.},

This paper addresses key issues involved in making such an assessment, in particular, the conceptualisation and measurement of gender equality. It starts with a consideration of three different perspectives concerning the conceptualisation of â€œimprovementâ€ as either economic development, human capabilities, or gender equality. This is followed by an analysis of the tensions between three different models of gender equality. The final section is a critical review of the operationalisation of these concepts and the collection of data necessary to assess progress on each of the 12 critical areas of concern of the UN Platform for Action. In particular, what are the best indicators? The paper engages with the development of international standards of gender equality with a focus on their application in the EU region.},

  abstract = {The Central American migrant caravans of 2018 are best understood as having been precipitated by entangled multi-scalar geopolitical histories among the United States, Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. Unsurprisingly, the migrants traveling north to the United States garnered widespread attention on social media. So much so that the reaction to the caravan accelerated plans to deploy troops to the US southern border and deny Central Americans the opportunity to seek asylum. This example showcases how the digital world can have exponential material effects. While coverage on border security and migration has been extensive, within political geography, such concerns have rarely been paired with social media. In this article, we take as our object of analysis the digitality or â€œdigital lifeâ€ of the migrant caravan. Mapping the patterns of migrant caravan-related tweeting paired with the exploration of Twitterâ€™s networked dimensions reveals the platform to be a fundamentally spatial technology. Rather than reflect, refract or distort, Twitter produces and (its power) is in turn produced through spatial mechanisms. We present multiple cartographic visualizations in support of this claim and highlight the ways in which a contextual knowledge of the subject under studyâ€”the migrant caravanâ€”can further inform analyses of Big Data.},

  abstract = {Background: Crowdsourcing, outsourcing problems and tasks to a crowd, has grown exponentially since the term was coined a decade ago. Being a rapid and inexpensive approach, it is particularly amenable to addressing problems in global health, conflict and humanitarian settings, but its potential has not been systematically assessed. We employed the Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative's (CHNRI) method to generate a ranked list of potential uses of crowdsourcing in global health and conflict. Process: 94 experts in global health and crowdsourcing submitted their ideas, and 239 ideas were scored. Each expert scored ideas against three of seven criteria, which were tailored specifically for the exercise. A relative ranking was calculated, along with an Average Expert Agreement (AEA). Findings: On a scale from 0-100, the scores assigned to proposed ideas ranged from 80.39 to 42.01. Most ideas were related to problem solving (n\,=\,112) or data generation (n\,=\,91). Using health care workers to share information about disease outbreaks to ensure global response had the highest score and agreement. Within the top 15, four additional ideas related to containing communicable diseases, two ideas related to using crowdsourcing for vital registration and two to improve maternal and child health. The top conflict ideas related to epidemic responses and various aspects of disease spread. Wisdom of the crowds and machine learning scored low despite being promising in literature. Interpretations: Experts were invited to generate ideas during the Ebola crisis and to score during reports of Zika, which may have affected the scoring. However, crowdsourcing's rapid, inexpensive characteristics make it suitable for addressing epidemics. Given that many ideas reflected Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), crowdsourcing may be an innovative solution to achieving some of the SDGs.},

  abstract = {Background: Crowdsourcing is a nascent phenomenon that has grown exponentially since it was coined in 2006. It involves a large group of people solving a problem or completing a task for an individual or, more commonly, for an organisation. While the field of crowdsourcing has developed more quickly in information technology, it has great promise in health applications. This review examines uses of crowdsourcing in global health and health, broadly. Methods: Semantic searches were run in Google Scholar for "crowdsourcing," "crowdsourcing and health," and similar terms. 996 articles were retrieved and all abstracts were scanned. 285 articles related to health. This review provides a narrative overview of the articles identified. Results: Eight areas where crowdsourcing has been used in health were identified: diagnosis; surveillance; nutrition; public health and environment; education; genetics; psychology; and, general medicine/other. Many studies reported crowdsourcing being used in a diagnostic or surveillance capacity. Crowdsourcing has been widely used across medical disciplines; however, it is important for future work using crowdsourcing to consider the appropriateness of the crowd being used to ensure the crowd is capable and has the adequate knowledge for the task at hand. Gamification of tasks seems to improve accuracy; other innovative methods of analysis including introducing thresholds and measures of trustworthiness should be considered. Conclusion: Crowdsourcing is a new field that has been widely used and is innovative and adaptable. With the exception of surveillance applications that are used in emergency and disaster situations, most uses of crowdsourcing have only been used as pilots. These exceptions demonstrate that it is possible to take crowdsourcing applications to scale. Crowdsourcing has the potential to provide more accessible health care to more communities and individuals rapidly and to lower costs of care.},

  abstract = {In this article, I develop a critical analysis of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) agenda and its commitment to â€˜leave no one behindâ€™. The Preamble to the Resolution on the SDGs adopted by the United Nations General Assembly stated the following: â€˜We are resolved to free the human race from the tyranny of poverty and want and to heal and secure our planet. (. . .) As we embark on this collective journey, we pledge that no one will be left behindâ€™. Through a close examination of the SDG initiativeâ€”and aligned concrete policy proposalsâ€”I demonstrate that the project to â€˜leave no one behindâ€™ rests on specific ideological premises: it is designed to promote and consolidate a highly contested neo-liberal variant of capitalist development. The SDGs are framed as a universal project, with quite substantial institutional monitoring mechanisms aimed at ensuring the successful implementation of aligned policies. Indeed, as I demonstrate, the implementation of highly contested neoliberal policies are themselves explicit goals of the SDG agenda. In this respect, the SDGs differ significantly from the Millennium Development Goal initiative. The argument I develop demonstrates that the SDG agenda may be aimed in part at undermining political struggles that aspire for more socially just and ecologically sustainable approaches to development. Overall, I argue that the explicit commitment to â€˜leave no one behindâ€™ is a discourse that is strategically deployed to justify the implementation of a highly problematic political project as the framework of global development. This is a framework that privileges commercial interests over commitments to provide universal entitlements to address fundamental life-sustaining needs. Political struggles over development will continue against the ideology of the SDG project and for transformative shifts for actually sustainable development.},

Have developed countries respected their financial commitments? Which countries have been the main beneficiaries of international climate money? As simple as these questions may seem, answers to them have proved to be highly controversial and have contributed to a continuous erosion of trust between Parties in international climate negotiations. This article explores the controversies around international climate finance figures. It examines how the lack of internationally agreed modalities to account for climate finance has given rise to a plethora of accounting and reporting practices that leads to widely contrasting statements on climate finance. We show that, despite some gaps, the Paris Agreementâ€™s â€œenhanced transparency frameworkâ€ could lead to marked improvements in the way climate finance is accounted and reported.},

Comparison of recall of key symptoms and longitudinal reports shows the accuracy of recall, not just reliability.Method. At age 25, 1003 members of the Christchurch Health and Development Study cohort were asked to recall key symptoms of depression (sadness, loss of interest) up to age 21. This recall was compared with longitudinal reports at ages 15, 16, 18 and 21 years. Diagnosis was by DSM-III-R and DSM-IV criteria.Results. Only 4\% of those without previous reports recalled key symptoms. Of those with a diagnosis of depression up to age 21, 44\% recalled a key symptom. Measures of severity of an episode (number of symptoms, impairment, duration, suicidality) and chronicity (years with a diagnosis, years with suicidal ideation) all strongly predicted recall. Current key symptoms increased recall, even after taking account of severity and chronicity. Being female and receiving treatment also predicted recall, although odds ratios were reduced to 1Â·6â€“1Â·7 when all other predictors were included. Comparison of risk factors for key symptoms showed similar results from longitudinal reports and recall. Sexual abuse, neuroticism, lack of parental attachment, gender, physical abuse and maternal depression were major risk factors in both sets of analyses.Conclusions. Forgetting of prior episodes of depression was common. Severity, chronicity, current depression, gender and treatment predicted recall. Lifetime prevalence based on recall will be markedly underestimated but the identification of major risk factors may be relatively little impaired.},

The aim of the paper is to set out a basic framework for exploring this further. Noting many continuities with colonial formations, it identifies three critical dimensions of development which need to be interrogated: its material outcomes; its techniques of transformation; and its modes of knowing. Its analysis of race emphasises the diversity of understandings and the fluidity between them which underlie both their potential for transformation and their resilience. Following Omi and Winant's work on the USA, development is suggested to comprise a process of racial formation, made up of a vast range of diverse and contradictory racial projects which link the meaning of ethnic, racial and national identities to material entitlements.},

Efforts are being made by NGOs, United Nations Agencies and to a lesser extent the donor community, but these efforts are fragmented.Practical implications - If logistics in humanitarian relief is supported and valued the effectiveness and predictability of humanitarian response will improve. Even small improvements in efficiency in logistics will result in significant savings in logistics costs.Originality value - There is little published in logistics for humanitarian relief and disseminating the importance of logistics in humanitarian aid and the challenges it faces will assist the donor community, the NGOs and the field logisticians in raising the profile of logistics.},

This paper tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.},

A large proportion of total global impacts can be associated with trade, and the trend is rising. Advances in global multi-region input-output models have allowed researchers to draw detailed, international supply-chain connections between harmful production in social and environmental hotspots and affluent consumption in global centres of wealth. The general direction of impact displacement is from developed to developing countriesâ€”an increase of health impacts in China from air pollution linked to export production for the United States being one prominent example. The relocation of production across countries counteracts national mitigation policies and may negate ostensible achievements in decoupling impacts from economic growth. A comprehensive implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals therefore requires the inclusion of footprint indicators to avoid loopholes in national sustainability assessments.},

Measurement encounters two sets of interrelated problems: those of the definition and nature of ethnicity as a social phenomenon and its individual subjective experience and those of the derivation of valid and reliable categories. Commonly used single-item measures fail to capture many ethnic groups and may be of limited value. Extending categories in these will capture more groups, but can be unwieldy and produce small cell counts, whereas multiple measures can be more successful, but are practically less viable in general surveys. We conclude that whilst these difficulties are probably insurmountable, a strategy that is sensitive to the presence of ethnic groups in particular localities is a way forward, but this should also be part of a more sociologically nuanced approach to the collection of ethnic data.},

Greater attention to race and ethnicity in research on youth programs can provide insight into the relevance of PYD models for specific groups of youth, culturally-specific themes that might enhance the applicability of PYD models and programs for some groups, the role of within-group heterogeneity with respect to PYD outcomes, and the aspects of PYD models and programs that appear to be essential for all youth across sociocultural contexts.},

To assist in this analysis, we draw from a tripartite conceptualisation of accountability and focus particularly on monitoring and review. We use a human rights framework to explore whether the agreed SDG3 indicators for â€˜follow-up and reviewâ€™ promote the collection of data that could demonstrate health rights entitlements are being respected, protected and fulfilled. We find there are gaps through which breaches of human rights could fall undetected, especially around participation and quality health care. We find statistics are frequently absent in countries and communities most â€˜left behindâ€™, and suggestions that Big Data could fill these statistical gaps ignore the realities of poor information systems and the digital divide. We conclude that well resourced countries have human rights obligations to provide assistance where needed to national statistics offices to improve their capacity to contribute to human rights accountability mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Background: Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are the leading cause of death globally. Eighty-two percent of premature NCD deaths occur within low- and lower middle-income countries (LLMICs). Research to date, largely drawn from high-income countries, suggests that disadvantaged and marginalized groups have a higher NCD burden, but there has been a dearth of research studying this relationship within LLMICs. The purpose of this systematic review is to map the literature on evidence from LLMICs on the socio-economic status (SES) gradient of four particular NCDs: cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, and chronic respiratory diseases. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive literature search for primary research published between 1 January 1990 and 27 April 2015 using six bibliographic databases and web resources. We included studies that reported SES and morbidity or mortality from cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and chronic respiratory diseases within LLMICs. Results: Fifty-seven studies from 17 LLMICs met our inclusion criteria. Fourteen of the 18 papers that reported significant associations between cancer and SES suggested that low SES groups had the highest cancer risk. Eleven of 15 papers reporting significant relationships between CVD and SES suggested that low SES groups have higher risk. In contrast, seven of 12 papers reporting significant findings related to diabetes found that higher SES groups had higher diabetes risk. We identified just three studies on the relationship between chronic respiratory diseases and SES; none of them reported significant findings. Conclusions: Only 17 of the 84 LLMICs were represented, highlighting the need for more research on NCDs within these countries. The majority of studies were medium to high quality cross-sectional studies. When we restricted our analyses to high quality studies only, for both cancer and cardiovascular disease more than half of studies found a significantly higher risk for those of lower SES. The opposite was true for diabetes, whilst there was a paucity of high quality research on chronic respiratory disease. Development programmes must consider health alongside other aims and NCD prevention interventions must target all members of the population.

CDD quickly became one of the pillars of this strategy, with its primary goal of reducing diarrhea-associated mortality among infants and young children in developing countries. WHO expanded the previous cholera-focused unit into one that addressed all diarrheal diseases, and uniquely combined support to research and to national CDD Programs. We describe the history of the Program, summarize the results of the research it supported, and illustrate the outcome of the Programâ€™s control efforts at country and global levels. We then relate the subsequent evolution of the Program to an approach that was more technically broad and programmatically narrow and describe how this affected diarrheal diseases-related activities globally and in countries.},

The purpose of this paper is first, to explore these shortcomings within the peer-reviewed literature and, second, propose a starting point for a solution with a decentralized humanitarian aid deployment (DHAD) framework. Design/methodology/approach The authors conducted a focused, qualitative review of available and relevant literature. Findings The literature reviewed demonstrates that current centralized humanitarian aid deployment models lack meaningful engagement of local assets while indicating a plausible connection between these same models and disaster urbanization. Next, the literature shows introducing a new decentralized model could represent a sustainable aid deployment standard for that countryâ€™s specific response, recovery, mitigation and planning opportunities and constraints. Research limitations/implications The next step is to develop a working DHAD model for a lower-income country using a multi-layered, GIS analysis that incorporates some or all of the socioeconomic and environmental variables suggested herein. Practical implications The practical potential of the DHAD framework includes establishing the impacted country in the lead role of their own recovery at the moment of deployment, no longer relying on foreign logistics models to sort it out once aid has arrived. Originality/value This paper discusses a topic that much of the literature agrees requires more research while suggesting a new conceptual framework for aid deployment best practices which is also largely absent from the literature.},

This study investigates the attributes and effectiveness of donor-supported programmes and projects that worked well under difficult conditions in fragile states. Presented in this study are nine development initiatives in six less developed countries - Afghanistan, Cambodia, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, Timor Leste and Uganda. The cases show that development initiatives, which engage local communities and local level governments, are often able to have significant impact. However, for more substantial improvements to take places, localized gains need to be scaled up either horizontally (other localities) or vertically (to higher levels). Given the advantages of working at the local level and the difficulty of working through mainstream bureaucratic agencies at higher levels in these countries, donors often prefer to create 'parallel-agencies' to reach out to larger numbers of beneficiaries. However, this may in the long run weaken the legitimacy of mainstream government institutions, and donor agencies may therefore choose to work as closely as possible with government officials from the beginning to build trust and demonstrating that new initiatives are non-threatening and help prepare the eventual mainstreaming of 'parallel agencies'.},

This project included a work package on environmental health challenges in urban planning which had the objective to review - based on contributions from scientific experts and urban planners and practitioners - the impact and effectiveness of current regulatory frameworks and European Directives that affect urban planning and urban environmental conditions. The perspective of local authorities as the implementer of urban planning was used for the discussion and case studies on environmental health dimensions of urban planning were prepared by two cities. This meeting report provides (a) the summary notes of an expert meeting held in fall 2008, (b) an evidence review on the urban planning impacts on environment and health, and (c) summary reports of two case study cities on their local priority challenges. In conclusion, the challenges faced by local authorities in daily urban planning practice are highlighted and associated with the regulatory frameworks on international level. Various suggestions are being made to equip local authorities with better frameworks and resources to make urban settings healthier.},

However, little is known about the impacts of international trade on progress towards achieving the SDG targets. Here we show that international trade positively affected global progress towards achieving nine environment-related SDG targets. International trade improved the SDG target scores of most (65\%) of the evaluated developed countries but reduced the SDG target scores of over 60\% of the evaluated developing countries. The SDG target scores of developed countries were higher than those of developing countries when trade was accounted for, but those scores would be lower than those of developing countries if trade were not a factor. Furthermore, trade between distant countries contributed more to achieving these global SDG targets than trade between adjacent countries. Compared with adjacent trade, distant trade was more beneficial for achieving SDG targets in developed countries, but it more negatively affected SDG target scores in developing countries. Our research suggests that enhancing the accounting for and management of virtual resources embedded in trade is essential for achieving and balancing sustainable development for all.},

Although studies have shown that regionally disaggregated model and model that distinguishes processing exports at the national level are necessary to estimate the embodied emissions in China's exports, no study evaluates this issue by simultaneously taking both regional and trade heterogeneity into account. To fill this gap, we re-estimate the CO2 emissions embodied in Chinaâ€™s exports at both regional and industrial level, by using the newly-developed inter-regional input-output (IRIOP) model that distinguishes processing trade from other trade at the regional level. Results show that compared to the IRIOP model, the traditional multi-regional input-output (MRIO) model has overestimated the environmental loss from exports by 14\%â€“25\% in 2002 and 7\%â€“20\% in 2012 for different regions. The largest bias is found in regions and industries with the highest processing export shares. Therefore, the IRIOP model gives more accurate accounting on the regional environmental loss due to national exports and thus is important for establishing effective emission mitigation policies.},

  abstract = {The utilisation of data and technology in transportation has given rise to new forms of flexible, on-demand mobility and urban freight services. Such advances have also enabled the integration of multiple transportation modes and facilitated more predictable, environmentally-friendly, high-volume trips. While many of these technologies are now commonplace in higher income cities, they are less prevalent in lower income cities. This review identifies a) recent advances in technology and data that can facilitate multimodal urban travel, and b) the existing and potential application of these advances in low- and lower middle-income (LIC and LMIC) cities, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. This review examines peer-reviewed and grey literature and uses a multi-method approach with expert  interviews. The review identifies open transportation data and data standards, global positioning systems, cashless fare payment, and blockchain as having high potential to facilitate integrated mobility in lower income contexts, and considers potential barriers to adopting and risks of utilising these technologies in LICs and LMICs. The review finds that, enabled by technology and data advances, LICs and LMICs could leapfrog the high car use and inefficient urban freight systems typical of higher income cities to more integrated, efficient, multimodal transport systems},

  abstract = {The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) negotiations aspire to create the world's most ambitious trade agreement between the world's two largest economies. The politics associated with TTIP are different from those associated with previous trade negotiations. Moreover, they diverge from the prevailing International Political Economy (IPE) account of trade policy. The politics of TTIP diverge from the conventional IPE account of trade politics in two particularly noteworthy ways. First, rather than being rivals, American and European business interests are allies, adopting common positions on what they want the agreement to look like. Second, opposition within both the USA and the EU comes not primarily from firms and workers fearing increased economic competition, but from less traditional trade actors â€“ consumer and environmental groups and citizens â€“ concerned about the erosion of valued regulations. I argue that the unusual politics is the product of two distinct, but related factors. The first is the extraordinary level of cross-investment between the two economies. The second concerns the unique emphasis on addressing non-tariff barriers, particularly regulatory differences, and the significance of the negotiating partner. I test the plausibility of these arguments through within-case variation and by preliminary comparison to other contemporary negotiations of â€˜deepâ€™ preferential trade agreements.},

It concludes that the strategy is unlikely to address the identified problem, because it largely reflects continuity with past practices that did not prevent or resolve the politicization of trade policy. It also concludes that the Commissionâ€™s assessment of the politicization of trade policy is exaggerated. Thus, two wrongs may have produced the â€˜rightâ€™ policy, at least in the narrow sense that EU trade policy is unlikely to be as politically fraught in future.},

Using data from 9,261 households in 25 LMICs, subsets of candidate items were evaluated on their predictive accuracy, criterion validity, and sensitivityâ€“specificity. A subset with items assessing â€œworry,â€ â€œchanging plans,â€ â€œlimited drinking water,â€ and â€œinability to wash handsâ€ because of problems with water (range: 0â€“12) were highly correlated with full HWISE Scale scores (correlation coefficient: 0.949â€“0.980) and introduced minimal additional error (root mean square error: 2.13â€“2.68). Criterion validity was demonstrated, and a cut point of â‰¥ 4 correctly classified more than 91\% of households as water secure or insecure.

  abstract = {Background: Health service data are used to inform decisions about planning and implementation, as well as to evaluate performance and outcomes, and the quality of those data are important. Data quality assessments (DQA) afford the opportunity to collect information about health service data. Through its Rapid Access Expansion Programme (RAcE), the World Health Organization (WHO) funded non-governmental organizations (NGO) to support Ministries of Health (MOH) in implementing integrated community case management (iCCM) programs in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Malawi, Mozambique, Niger and Nigeria. WHO contracted ICF to support grantee monitoring and evaluation efforts, part of which was to conduct DQAs to enhance program monitoring and decision making. The contribution of DQAs to data-driven decision making has been documented and the purpose of this paper is to describe how DQAs contributed to health management information system (HMIS) strengthening and the findings of subsequent DQAs in those areas. Methods: ICF created a mixed-methods DQA for iCCM data, comprising a review of the data collection and management system, a data tracing component and key informant interviews. The DQA was applied twice in each RAcE site, which enables a general comparison of system-level attributes before and after the first DQA application. For this qualitative assessment, we reviewed DQA reports to collate information about DQA recommendations and how they were addressed before a subsequent DQA, along with the findings of the second DQA. Results: Findings from the first DQA in each RAcE site stimulated NGO and MOH efforts to strengthen different aspects of the HMIS in each country, including modifying data collection tools in the Democratic Republic of Congo; training community health workers (CHWs) and supervisors in Malawi; strengthening supervision in Mozambique; improving CHW registers and strengthening staff capacity at all levels to report data in Niger; establishing a data review system in Abia State, Nigeria; and, establishing processes to improve data use and quality in Niger State, Nigeria. Conclusion: Data quality assessments stimulated context-specific efforts by NGOs and MOHs to improve iCCM data quality. DQAs can serve as a collaborative and evidence-based activity to influence discussions of data quality and stimulate HMIS strengthening efforts.},

  abstract = {Under the international agreements on climate change, states have a responsibility to mitigate their greenhouse gas emissions. We may refer to this as an â€œobligation to regulateâ€. This article argues that the general, treaty-derived obligation to regulate is supplemented by a separate legal principle on how to regulate: the principle that the polluter must pay. The obligation to arrest greenhouse gas emissions through regulation necessarily comes at a cost to states and individuals, as any regulation does. But the general obligation to regulate does not contain any guidance on who should bear the costs of regulation and under what circumstances. This is where the polluter pays principle comes in. In its legal instantiation, it is a principle of justice. It requires polluters, both states and individuals, to pay, because it is not fair that they assume unlimited access to the atmospheric commons. Yet, as a principle of justice, the polluter pays principle must itself be implemented fairly. Not every polluter should be made to pay, or pay the same amount, indiscriminately, or without support, if that would cause another, even greater, unfairness. Thus the polluter pays principle serves as a guide to how the general obligation of states to regulate is to be implemented.},

The number of criteria, currently sixteen, reflect a balance between ensuring that all key factors that foster pro-poor growth and poverty alleviation are captured, without overly burdening the evaluation process. Ratings for each of the criteria reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments. They focus on the quality of each country\&apos;s current policies and institutions - which are the main determinant of present aid effectiveness prospects. To fully underscore the importance of the CPIA in the IDA Performance Based Allocations, the overall country score is referred to as the IDA Resource Allocation Index (IRAI).},

  abstract = {We examine the current 'datafication' process underway in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), and the power shifts it is creating in the field of international development. The use of new communications and database technologies in LMICs is generating 'big data' (for example from the use of mobile phones, mobile-based financial services and the internet) which is collected and processed by corporations. When shared, these data are also becoming a potentially valuable resource for development research and policy. With these new sources of data, new power structures are emerging within the field of development. We identify two trends in particular, illustrating them with examples: first, the empowerment of public-private partnerships around datafication in LMICs and the consequently growing agency of corporations as development actors. Second, the way commercially generated big data is becoming the foundation for country-level 'data doubles', i.e. digital representations of social phenomena and/or territories that are created in parallel with, and sometimes in lieu of, national data and statistics. We explore the resulting shift from legibility (Scott, 1998) to visibility, and the implications of seeing development interventions as a byproduct of larger-scale processes of informational capitalism.},

The Financing for Development Summit in July 2015 presents a crucial opportunity to make the case for increased investments in development data, but to do so the statistical community need to agree upon a robust estimate of resource needs. Data for Development: A Needs Assessment for SDG Monitoring and Capacity Development,~prepared by a broad coalition of data for development experts convened by SDSN, attempts to respond to that challenge. â€œData for Development: A Needs Assessment for SDG Monitoring and Statistical Capacity Developmentâ€ estimates that the IDA-eligible countries will need to spend \$1 billion a year to upgrade their statistical systems and carry out regular data collection for the SDGs. Donors must maintain current contributions to statistics, of approximately US\$300 million per annum, and go further, leveraging US\$100-200 million more in Official Development Assistance (ODA) to support country efforts. For their part, recipient countries must commit to fill the gap, mobilizing domestic resources behind clear national strategies for the development of statistics (NSDSs). Both donors and recipient countries must look to join the data revolution. The unprecedented rate of innovation in data collection techniques and technologies and the capacity to distribute data widely and freely has expanded the horizon of possibility. The adoption of the SDGs presents a strategic opportunity to realize the data revolution and demonstrate the centrality of data for development.}

  urldate = {2020-07-27},
  abstract = {This commentary is an updated version of one originally published April 13, 2020. Confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) exceed 3 million as of April 30 and continue to climb. To combat the virusâ€™ spread, governments have implemented restrictions on economic activity unprecedented in peacetime. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development estimates that containment measures will cause an initial decline in the level of output of 20 to 25 percent in many economies, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects negative global growth for 2020 with â€œthe worst economic fallout since the Great Depression.â€ In response to this unprecedented shock, governments have pledged massive economic support, from direct payments to individuals to â€œlimitlessâ€ loans for struggling businesses. At a March 26 virtual summit, leaders of the Group of Twenty (G20) major economies said they were spending over \$5 trillion, equivalent to 7.4 percent of 2019 G20 countriesâ€™ gross domestic product (GDP), to â€œcounteract the social, economic, and financial impacts of the pandemic.â€ Since then, G20 governments have added to this figure as the extent of the economic fallout has become clearer. Developed by the CSIS iDeas Lab. Data updated through April 29, 2020 The CSIS Simon Chair analyzed and categorized major fiscal actions taken by G20 countries to respond to the economic shock. Several key trends emerge: Fiscal support has increased since April 10: As of April 29, we estimate that G20 countries are providing \$6.3 trillion in fiscal support, representing 9.3 percent of 2019 G20 GDP. Of the total, \$3.2 trillion will support direct government spending (4.8 percent of 2019 G20 GDP), up from \$2.1 trillion (3.1 percent of GDP) as of April 10. Credit enhancements contribute \$2.3 trillion and tax relief another \$0.8 trillion. G20 loan guarantee frameworks alone exceed \$2 trillion: G20 economies, led by European countries, have announced loan guarantee frameworks exceeding \$2 trillion, representing 3 percent of 2019 G20 GDP. Given that many guarantee frameworks do not quantify ex ante fiscal outlays, we assign a 50 percent â€œfiscal costâ€ to guarantee figures resulting in our headline fiscal support figure of \$6.3 trillion. Assigning a 100 percent â€œfiscal costâ€ to loan guarantees would boost our headline figure to \$7.4 trillion, or 10.8 percent of GDP. Conversely, assigning zero â€œfiscal costâ€ to loan guarantees would lower our headline figure to \$5.3 trillion, or 7.8 percent of GDP. Emerging market (EM) economies have boosted spending but still lag advanced economy (AE) peers by a wide margin: G20 EM fiscal support as of April 29 averages 3.2 percent of GDP, an increase of 1.2 percentage points since April 10 but still well below the average of 11.6 percent for AEs. Chinaâ€™s announcement of 2.3 trillion yuan (\$326 billion) in local government special purpose bond issuance brings its fiscal response to 3.7 percent of GDP, still well below the amount provided during the global financial crisis. Initial data updated through April 10 show the following trends: The largest component of fiscal support is intended to provide financing to businesses: As of April 10, 2020, we estimate G20 countries to have pledged \$5.3 trillion in fiscal support, representing 7.8 percent of 2019 G20 GDP. Of the total, \$2.5 trillion will support credit enhancements (3.7 percent of 2019 G20 GDP), compared to \$2.1 trillion (3.1 percent of GDP) in direct government spending and \$0.6 trillion (0.9 percent) in tax relief. (Our analysis does not include tax deferments.) Almost all support focuses on keeping companies and individuals afloat rather than stimulating new demand and investment, which will become the priority when health restrictions ease. Direct government spending is higher than levels during the global financial crisis (GFC), so far: The 3.1 percent of G20 2019 GDP in direct government spending compares to 2.5 percent of G20 GDP in 2008-2009 â€œcrisis-related discretionary measuresâ€ in response to the GFC. By the end of the pandemic, G20 countries will likely have spent far more than they did in the GFC as a percent of GDP. G20 countries have responded faster than during the GFC: In response to the pandemic, G20 governments announced nearly 8 percent of GDP in fiscal support between early February and early April, with more expected in the coming weeks and months. During the GFC, governmentsâ€™ responses were more protracted: in the United States, the epicenter of the GFC, the Economic Stimulus Act was signed into law in February 2008; the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, which included government funding for the purchase of troubled assets from financial institutions, was signed in October 2008; and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which authorized significant government spending, was signed in February 2009. Thus far, Chinaâ€™s fiscal response is more limited than during the GFC: Chinaâ€™s fiscal support as of April 10 amounts to roughly 1.3 percent of GDP, primarily through loans for impacted businesses and tax relief. This spending at the national level is far lower than the nearly 13 percent of GDP in fiscal spending (inclusive of local, provincial, and national spending) China announced in November 2008 in response to the GFC. Chinese officials have recently signaled they could provide additional stimulus later this year as the health situation stabilizes, but a desire to avoid adding to already high total debt levels will likely limit potential spending. EM economies are more constrained: As a percent of GDP, EM members of the G20 have announced far less fiscal support than AE G20 peers, reflecting, in part, more binding financing constraints. G20 EM fiscal support as of April 10 averages 2 percent of GDP versus 11.7 percent among G20 AEs. Many EMs are at an earlier stage of the pandemic relative to many AEs and may need international support to finance necessary relief measures. Notes: In addition to national efforts detailed above, the European Union has announced several responses: a 37 billion euro (\$40 billion) Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative and a 540 billion euro (\$586 billion) aid package to support member states. Both are not included in the \$6.3 trillion G20 total. Of the \$6.3 trillion of fiscal relief announced by G20 countries as of April 29, about \$45 billion was not itemized as credit enhancement, government spending, or tax relief. This analysis focuses on major, national, discretionary responses in G20 countries and thus does not reflect the full extent of support deployed by these countries in response to Covid-19, such as monetary and regulatory tools (rate cuts, repurchase operations, quantitative easing), automatic spending mechanisms, and additional support from subnational government. We include tax cuts and cancellations in tax relief but do not assign a monetary value to tax deferrals, where possible.

  abstract = {Three years into the 2030 Agenda it is already apparent that those living in fragile contexts are the furthest behind. Not all forms of fragility make it to the publicâ€™s eye: fragility is an intricate beast, sometimes exposed, often lurking underneath, but always holding progress back. Conflict, forced displacement, violent extremism, famine etc. are all causes and consequences of fragility. Hence the need to better understand, anticipate and respond to fragility. States of Fragility 2018 exposes the critical challenge posed by fragility in achieving the aspirations of the 2030 Agenda, sustainable development and peace. It highlights twelve key aspects of fragility, defying common assumptions and simplistic categorisation. It documents progress made in fragile situations on attaining sustainable development, unveiling exit doors from the fragility trap. It then illustrates the current state of financing to address fragility and suggests more effective approaches, accounting for its multidimensionality. Above all, the report aims to strike a balance between fragility's inherent complexity and the degree of simplicity that is required for efficient policy and decision making, namely through systems-based thinking; longer-term, consistent aid plans; the financing of peace; and a persistent focus on human beings.},

  abstract = {This 2015 OECD report on fragility contributes to the broader debate to define and implement post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It points out that addressing fragility in the new framework will be crucial if strides in reducing poverty are to be made. It argues in favour of proposed SDG 16 â€“ promoting peaceful and inclusive societies â€“ which aims to reduce violence of all forms. The 2015 report differs markedly from previous editions as it seeks to present a new understanding of fragility beyond fragile states. It assesses fragility as an issue of universal character that can affect all countries, not only those traditionally considered â€œfragileâ€ or conflict-affected. To do so, it takes three indicators related to targets of SDG 16 and two from the wider SDG framework: violence, access to justice, accountable and inclusive institutions, economic inclusion and stability, and capacities to prevent and adapt to social, economic and environmental shocks and disasters. It applies them to all countries worldwide, and identifies the 50 most vulnerable ones in all five dimensions. The group of countries most challenged on all five fronts differs little from the traditional list of fragile states and economies. Still, several middle-income countries with disproportionately high levels of crime-related violence, sub-national conflict or poor access to justice move into the spotlight. The report concludes that making headway on the targets will require building a new portfolio of tools and interventions, and an understanding of the role the international community should and can play in assisting this process.},

While there are many technical and methodological challenges inherent in improving~disaggregation, some of the largest barriers are political and financial. The Inclusive Data Charter (IDC) was developed by a task team of GPSDD partners to mobilize political commitments and meaningful actions to advance inclusive and disaggregated data.  The IDC advances the availability and use of inclusive and disaggregated data so that governments and organizations better understand, address, and monitor the needs of marginalized people and ensure no one is left behind. Launched in 2018, the IDC has quickly built momentum for inclusive data, garnered commitments from 20 diverse Champions, and supported them in accelerating and deepening progress.~ Inclusive Data Charter vision and principles~(AR,~EN, ES,~FR) Inclusive Data Charter FAQs (AR, EN, ES, FR) Inclusive Data Charter 2019 monitoring round Champions' Action Plans}

It finds that the growth in cross-border positions in relation to world GDP has come to a halt. This reflects much weaker capital flows to and from advanced economies, with diminished cross-border banking activity, and an increase in the weight of emerging economies in global GDP, as these economies have lower external assets and liabilities than advanced economies. Cross-border FDI positions have continued to expand, unlike positions in portfolio instruments and other investment. This expansion reflects primarily positions vis-Ã -vis financial centers, suggesting that the complexity of the corporate structure of large multinational corporations is playing an important role. The paper also explores the cross-country drivers of foreign ownership of domestic debt securities, highlighting in particular the role of the euro debt crisis in explaining its evolution.},

(2016) to quantify how changes in aggregate demand due to additional income from householdâ€™s remittances propagates through the network of input-output linkages in Sub-Saharan African countries. We first propose two network centrality measures to assess the role of some sectors as key input providers in the economy. Then, we use these measures to quantify the effect of sectoral linkages on sectoral and total output following an increase in remittances inflows. Our empirical results suggest that the effects of remittances on recipient economies increase with the degree of linkages across sectors, which is especially prominent in the case of the financial intermediation sector. Our paper contributes to the emerging macroeconomic literature on the propagation of shocks across sectors and the implications for the whole economy.},

While it is undeniable that remittances have poverty-alleviating and consumption-smoothing effects on recipient households, a key empirical question is whether they also serve to promote long-run economic growth. This study tackles this question and addresses the main shortcomings of previous empirical work, focusing on the appropriate measurement, and incorporating an instrument that is both correlated with remittances and would only be expected to affect growth through its effect on remittances. The results show that, at best, workers' remittances have no impact on economic growth.},

  abstract = {The role of trade in the global economy is at a critical juncture. Increased trade integration helped to drive economic growth in advanced and developing economies in the latter part of the 20th century. Since the early 2000\&rsquo;s, however, a slowdown in the pace of trade reform, a post-crisis uptick in protectionism, and risk of further reversals have been a drag on trade, productivity, and income growth. At the same time, trade is leaving too many individuals and communities behind, notably also in advanced economies. To be sure, job losses in certain sectors or regions in advanced economies have resulted to a large extent from technological changes rather than from trade. But adjustment to trade can bring a human and economic downside that is frequently concentrated, sometimes harsh, and has too often become prolonged. It need not be that way. With the right policies, countries can benefit from the great opportunities that trade brings and lift up those who have been left behind. Those polices ease adjustment to trade, as well as strengthen overall economic flexibility and performance.},

The chapter first describes how sustainability issues have been managed within EU external trade policy. The author recounts how the EU is striving to meet social and environmental challenges by focusing on the implementation of and compliance with the sustainability provisions of the EUâ€™s free trade agreements with international partners. Here, Zurek investigates both substantive and procedural aspects of the Trade and Sustainable Development (TSD) chapters and discusses the proposed reform on stronger implementation recently presented by the European Commission. Against the backdrop of an ongoing and growing discussion of the scope of the EUâ€™s authority and competence in external trade policy, Zurek considers two aspects of the European Court of Justiceâ€™s opinion on the Singapore agreement. First, the Court confirms that the TSD chapter falls under the EUâ€™s exclusive competence. Second, the Court confirms that a breach of the commitments concerning sustainable development in the free trade agreement should be regarded as a breach of the Vienna Convention and can thus be sanctioned.},
