# Global Climate Action: An Abbreviated History

By the mid-1970s, meteorologists and other atmospheric scientists began to express concern, following many forums for sharing scientific findings on climate change, such as the 1967 Global Atmospheric Research Program.[@Vardy2017a] At the time, the conversation largely focused on rising pollution-levels and emissions-related global warming, with the understanding of climate change that we have today coming later.[@Shaftela] As evidence mounted and concerns grew, scientists made a startling discovery in 1985: there was a hole in the o-zone layer over the South Pole.[@Solomon2019] This changed the entire political landscape in regards to thinking about the environment, but more so it provided a clear example of how humans can affect the environment through our social and economic systems- including development.[@Cawley2015]

To address the emerging dynamics, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was established in 1988. The IPCC's official charge is to "provide policymakers with regular scientific assessments on climate change, its implications and potential future risks, as well as to put forward adaptation and mitigation options."[@IPCC2021a] Created by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and confirmed in the United Nations General Assembly (UNGC) that year. From it's confirmation at the UNGA, Resolution 43/53, the IPCC was tasked to "was to prepare a comprehensive review and recommendations with respect to the state of knowledge of the science of climate change; the social and economic impact of climate change, and potential response strategies and elements for inclusion in a possible future international convention on climate."[@IPCC2021] Since then, the IPCC has set forth to create knowledge across countries, disciplines, and processes by providing technical, socio-economic, science-based reports that are "neutral, policy-relevant but not policy-prescriptive."[@IPCC2021]


What is important to understand here is just how important the creation of the IPCC was in bringing climate change to the global political stage. Think of how controversial climate change and humankind's role in creating it is today in modern politics. Now imagine how much more difficult it would be to convince countries, companies, and people to take action without the science behind it. Impossible, right? In 1990, the IPCC published their first report: the FAR, or First Assessment Report, which focused on the physical sciences of climate change and the first time that emissions data was collected with country-level disaggregation.[@Vardy2017]


Coming out of the FAR was an increased urgency to address sustainability, development, and climate change at the international level. Thus, only two short years later, in 1992 the United Nations Convention on Environment and Development held what is colloquially known as the "Rio Earth Summit." From this meeting emerged three new processes to protect the environment: the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), and the Convention on Biological Diversity (UNCBD). When thinking specifically about development and the SDGs, the UNFCCC is going to be the most important process for you to understand. Lucky for you it is super straightforward (Just kidding. It's very complex and nuanced, but we'll just introduce you to some of the elements that will be most important for you to know for this chapter). 


The UNFCCC is charged with the task "to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that will prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system, in a time frame which allows ecosystems to adapt naturally and enables sustainable development."[@UNFCCC2021b] Since 1992, this has meant the creation of a complex system of parallel processes that meet annually at what is known as the Conference of the Parties or COPs. This process, as noted by the SDGs, is the primary forum for addressing climate change and therefore its importance cannot be understated. But, like many of the other processes you've read about, the UNFCCC has long struggled to create the meaningful action that the countries most impacted by climate change, mostly developing countries and small island states, need. Behind these difficulties are conflicts relating to two key frameworks that are foundational to understanding the slow progress in addressing climate change: the polluters pay principle __[will be in a pull out box w/ definition]__ and the right to develop __(see ch.XYZ, page XYZ)__.[@Orellana2010] We'll explore these dimensions in relation to two of the most important climate proceedings and treaties to date: the Kyoto Protocol (COP3) and the Paris Agreement (COP21). A few of the other notable COPs for our indicators include Bali (COP13), Copenhagen (COP 15), Durban (COP17), Warsaw (COP19), __(See Table 13.xx for more about these meetings' outcomes)__. 


If you're familiar with climate change policy, you will no doubt have heard about the Kyoto Protocol. Agreed upon during the 1997 UNFCCC meetings in Kyoto, Japan, this was the first international process that attempted to address climate change, specifically to reduce the greenhouse gas(GHG) emissions of developed countries as rapidly as possible.[@UNFCCC2008] From 1997-2009, Kyoto was _the_ mechanism with the goal that developed countries would reduce their overall emissions to 5% from their 1990 levels--- and what's more, it was legally binding meaning that if countries did not meet their targets they could be fined. By the mid-2000s, the impacts of climate and the related emissions had gotten more clear and even more dire. Lord Nicholas Stern, a British economist, said of the new understanding of the science "emissions are growing faster than we thought, the absorption capacity of the planet is less than we thought, the probability of high temperatures is likely higher than we thought, and some of the effects are coming faster than we thought."[@Macabrey2009] Despite the alarming new IPCC reports and increasing climate-related disasters, such as Hurricane Katrina in the United State in 2007, developed countries were not following through with their commitments to the Kyoto Protocol to reduce their GHG emissions. What gives? A simple example of this breakdown was encapsulated during the Copenhagen COP16: Developed countries did not want to adopt what they saw as “restrictive” targets on limiting their emissions by 2020 and developing countries continued to assert their right to develop.[@Guardian2009] __[I can add more or less here]__ 

This breakdown led to the need to rebuild trust and figure out how to develop a process that could involve as many parties as possible in the global pursuit of lowering emissions and aiding in rapid adaptation, especially for developing countries. Thus, over the next few years the framework that led to the creation of the Paris Agreement in 2015 began.[@IISD2015] The Paris Agreement made some notable shifts from the Kyoto Protocol, namely regarding it's voluntary nature (meaning that countries would not be required to take any actions, the idea being that they would want to take action as a matter of good political will) and the shift in the emissions targets. If you remember, the Kyoto Protocol mandated that exclusively developed countries emit 5% less than 1990 GHG levels; the Paris Agreement makes the call for all countries to reduce overall GHG emissions to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. What? You thought it was 2 degrees? The 1.5 vs. 2 degrees story is a great segue into talking about our key players.

## Key Players


In addition to individual countries, there are a slew of key players that it's important to familiarize yourselves with. Within the UNFCCC there are nine non-party stakeholder groups called _constituencies_ including, Business and Industry NGOs (BINGO), Environmental NGOs (ENGO), Farmers, Indigenous peoples organizations (IPO), Local government and municipal authorities (LGMA), Research and independent NGOs (RINGO), Trade union NGOs (TUNGO), Women and Gender, and Youth NGOs (YOUNGO).[@UNFCCC2021c] While these constituencies are the formal pathway to engagement in the UNFCCC process, each one is made up by membership from dozens if not hundreds of different organizations, individuals, communities, researchers, businesses, and interest groups. Some of the more important civil society actors include the Climate Action Network (CAN) which has regional organizations that are made up of regional NGOs. There is the Climate Justice Alliance which is made up of individuals and organizations that advocate against business as usual in the negotiations, having been created a divide in approaches to advocacy between big green groups and justice-oriented groups became increasingly evident. __[Do we want to talk about G77+, AOSIS, LDCs, the African Group, etc?]__

__[more details will be adding, still compiling civil society accounts]__ 1.5 degree target was set after intense pressure from civil society groups and the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS).[@Webster2015] In 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a special report that detailed, "climate-related risks to health, livelihoods, food security, water supply, human security, and economic growth are projected to increase with global warming of 1.5$^\circ$C and increase further with 2$^\circ$C."[@IPCC2018a] __[related images https://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoworldwide/23010507764/in/album-72157661512826379/ ; https://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoworldwide/23270745029/in/album-72157661512826379/]__ 

## How Climate Change Processes Relate to Development

Under the Kyoto Protocol, the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) was created; a fund for developing countries to access for completing "emissions-reduction projects" and adaptation efforts which would be supported by a carbon markets scheme related to the emission reductions of developed countries, as per their responsibility to the Kyoto Protocol.[@Orellana2010] While this is not the most relevant aspect of the Kyoto Protocol to our upcoming discussion on finance, vulnerability, or emission data, the CDM is one of the few connections to a different UN process: Millenium Development Goals (MDGs), agreed upon in 2000. The precursor to the Sustainable Development Goals, the MDGs did not explicitly address climate change. Goal 7 to "Ensure Environmental Sustainability" included a few markers referring to the importance of mitigation and adaptation actions, but for the most part MDG goal 7's targets were linked to the protection of resources and biodiversity.[@MDGMonitor2016] [@UnitedNations2008] More specifically, Target 7.A called to "Integrate the principles of sustainable development into country policies and programmes and reverse the loss of environmental resources," but it was reportedly more through Goal 8's aim to transfer technology that linked the existing work of the CDM to the MDGs. The exclusion of climate change from the MDGs played a large role in the re-framing and movements toward the SDGs according to a “gaps” report published by the MDGs:

> The year 2015 is a milestone for global action: we will come to the end of the time frame in which we have been guided by the MDGs; we are launching a transformative development agenda, including a set of sustainable development goals (SDGs); and we are aiming for a meaningful and universal agreement on climate change. The transition from the MDGs to the SDGs presents a once-in a-generation opportunity to advance prosperity, secure the planet's sustainability for future generations, and unlock resources for investments in education, health, equitable growth and sustainable production and consumption.[@MDGGapTaskForce2015]


Coming into prominence in 2015, the SDGs and the Paris Agreement are both hailed as important, game-changing processes for international action on some of the most pressing global issues of today. Simultaneously, both processes are critiqued as upholding neoliberal values(Refer to page XYZ), not having reliable or measurable outcomes, and catering to the desires of the worlds' historic emitters and biggest economies over those of developing countries and those facing the burden of climate change. While we interrogate the data related to SDG Goal 13 as managed by the UNFCCC, ask yourself the following questions: who collects this information, who benefits from it, and why is it measured (or not) the way that it is?
