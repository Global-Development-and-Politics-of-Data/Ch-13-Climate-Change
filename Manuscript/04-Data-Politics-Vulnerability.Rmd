## Climate change vulnerabilities

The politics of counting human impacts from climate-related events can be quite contentious. One of the main issues of counting impacts is that it does not disaggregate dead, missing, or injured people by sex, age, disability, or income. This type of disaggregation allows to paint a clearer picture of the intensity of the impact. For example, the economic impact of the death of a person who is the prime income earner of a household might be felt differently from one household to another.

Another drawback of SDG's 13.1.1 indicator is that it only focuses on those that are *directly* affected by the climate-related events. It does not take into account indirect losses due to environmental disasters such as business interruptions, lost time at school, or foregone income, which do impact communities in the long-run.

Finally, the indicator only focuses on "small-scale sudden-onset disasters" and does not take into account disasters that are long in duration such as persistent droughts or epidemics.[@UNDRR2017] For example, the Global Burden of Disease Study found that almost two million people died from "non-optimal temperature," an increase of approximately 500,000 people since 1990.[@GlobalBurdenofDisease2021] These slow-onset trends are not represented in indicator 13.1.1 which is a missed opportunity to address climate change impacts that affect more livelihoods than we are willing to count.

The main argument for not counting slow-onset climate impacts has to do with attribution. __[Add example of attribution challenges]__
