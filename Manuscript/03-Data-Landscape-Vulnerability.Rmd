## Climate change vulnerabilities

Climate change vulnerabilities with respect to physical, human, and socio-economic systems vary widely across sectors and geographies. Measuring these vulnerabilities is usually complicated because of these context-specific differences. For example, measuring the impact of climate change on sea-level rise is not the same as measuring impacts on soil degradation. They each require different indicators, but ultimately they measure the same concept, i.e. climate vulnerability.

UNFCCC defines vulnerability as "the degree to which a system is susceptible to, or unable to cope with, adverse effects of climate change, including climate variability and extremes. Vulnerability is a function of the character, magnitude, and rate of climate variation to which a system is exposed, its sensitivity, and its adaptive capacity."[@UNFCCC2021] As you can tell, this definition is pretty loaded, and it even includes concepts that need further explanation than just defining vulnerability alone. For the purpose of this chapter, we will explore metrics that measure the consequences of these vulnerabilities in the face of climate-related disasters.

Therefore, when it comes to SDGs, target 13.1 on "strengthening resilience and adaptive capacity to climate hazards and natural disasters" highlights the dangers of structural vulnerabilities to these events, and the need to strengthen communities as a response to them. One of the associated indicators uses direct human losses to climate-related events as the main metric to measure community vulnerabilities, specifically the "number of deaths, missing persons and directly affected persons attributed to disasters per 100,000 population."[@UNDRR2018]

The United Nations Office for Disaster Reduction (UNDRR) is responsible for collecting the data on indicator 13.1.1, and counts impacts of climate-related events on human systems based on three criteria: deaths, missing, or directly affected. Deaths are straightforward in that a person dies during or after experiencing a climate-related event such as flooding, extreme heat/cold exposure, or any other climatic disaster. The 'missing' criteria, on the other, measures the number of people "whose whereabouts is unknown since the hazardous event." Finally, the 'directly affected' criteria counts the number of people that have experienced at least one of the following conditions since a hazardous event:

-   "Injury, illness, or other health effects"
-   Evacuation, displacement, or relocation
-   Any "direct damage to their livelihoods, economic, physical, social, cultural, and environmental assets"[@UNDRR2018]

The three criteria attributed to indicator 13.1.1 is also part of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, specifically Targets A and B which aim to "substantially reduce global disaster mortality", and "the number of people affected globally by 2030," respectively.[@UNDRR2015] These specific indicators were produced by an expert working group and endorsed by United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in 2017.[@UNGA2016] The Sendai Framework defines a disaster as "a serious disruption of the functioning of a community or a society involving widespread human, material, economic, or environmental losses and impacts, which exceeds the ability of the affected community or society to cope using its own resources."[@UNISDR2009]

The main compilers of global disaster mortality data is the Center for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED), which maintains the Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) covering more than "22,000 mass disasters around the world from 1900 to present day."[@CRED2021] [@UNDRR2021] The database also disaggregates the data by types of hazard, number of deaths, number of missing people, number of injured people, and a total monetary value of total impact of the disaster. EM-DAT collects this data from many sources such as international organizations, national governments, and even the press.[@CRED2021c]

It is worth noting, however, in order to record an entry into the database the impact of the disaster needs to "meet at least one of the following conditions:

-   **Death**: 10 or more people deaths

-   **Affected**: 100 or more people affected/injured/homeless

-   **Declaration/international appeal**: Declaration by the country of a state of emergency and/or an appeal for international assistance."[@CRED2021c]
